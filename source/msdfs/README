Setting up MS Dfs in Samba
kalele@veritas.com March 2000

Currently, MS Dfs support is a configure time parameter (--with-msdfs). Can be changed later to always compile it in..

To have a server announce itself as a Dfs server, add a "host msdfs=yes" entry to smb.conf.

To make a share a Dfs root, add a "msdfs root=yes" entry to the share definition 
in the smb.conf file.
e.g. 
[pub]
	path = /export/publicsmb
	msdfs root = yes

To create dfs volumes/junctions in the share, create symbolic links of the
format msdfs:server1\share1,server2\share2 and so on.

In the above example, create a dfs volume "dfsstorage" in the [pub] share as:
cd /export/publicsmb
ln -s msdfs:serverA\\share dfsstorage

Clicking on dfsstorage from a dfs-aware client will show you the contents of 
\\serverA\share

Shares with "msdfs root = no" (which is the default) entries are served as normal 
shares and the client stops talking Dfs with Samba after a tconX.

NOTES: 
* Windows clients need to be rebooted if a non-dfs root is made a dfs root or
  vice versa. A better option is to introduce a new share and make it the dfs root.
* Currently there's a restriction that msdfs symlink names should be all 
  lowercase.
