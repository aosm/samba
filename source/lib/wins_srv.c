/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- **
 * Discussion...
 *
 * This module implements WINS failover.
 *
 * Microsoft's WINS servers provide a feature called WINS replication,
 * which synchronises the WINS name databases between two or more servers. 
 * This means that the two servers can be used interchangably (more or
 * less). WINS replication is particularly useful if you are trying to
 * synchronise the WINS namespace between servers in remote locations, or
 * if your WINS servers tend to crash a lot. 
 *
 * WINS failover allows the client to 'switch' to a different WINS server
 * if the current WINS server mysteriously disappears.  On Windows
 * systems, this is typically represented as 'primary' and 'secondary'
 * WINS servers. 
 *
 * Failover only works if the WINS servers are synced.  If they are not,
 * then
 *   a) if the primary WINS server never fails the client will never 'see'
 *      the secondary (or tertiary or...) WINS server name space.
 *   b) if the primary *does* fail, the client will be entering an
 *      unfamiliar namespace.  The client itself will not be registered in
 *      that namespace and any names which match names in the previous
 *      space will likely resolve to different host IP addresses.
 *
 * One key thing to remember regarding WINS failover is that Samba does
 * not (yet) implement WINS replication.  For those interested, sniff port
 * 42 (TCP? UDP? ...dunno off hand) and see what two MS WINS servers do. 
 *
 * At this stage, only failover is implemented.  The next thing is to add
 * support for multi-WINS server registration and query (multi-membership).
 *
 * Multi-membership is a little wierd.  The idea is that the client can
 * register itself with multiple non-replicated WINS servers, and query
 * all of those servers (in a prescribed sequence) to resolve a name. 
 *
 * The implications of multi-membership are not quite clear.  Worth
 * trying, I suppose.  Changes will be needed in the name query and
 * registration code to accomodate this feature.  Also, there will need to
 * be some sort of syntax extension for the 'wins server' parameter in
 * smb.conf.  I'm thinking that a colon could be used as a separator. 
 *
 * Of course, for each WINS namespace there might be multiple, synced WINS
 * servers.  The change to this module would likely be the addition of a
 * linked list of linked lists.
