In no particular order:

- New packages for winbind stuff.
- Fix stuff in packaging/Debian/ (add infrastructure for stable
  builds)
- Compile with LDAP support.
- Finish debconf support.
- Test debconf support.
- Review /etc/init.d/samba (Brian White reports problems, should add
  --oknodo to start-stop-daemon)
