This is the Debian Linux prepackaged version of the Samba SMB
(LAN-Manager) server. Samba was written by Andrew Tridgell
<Andrew.Tridgell@anu.edu.au> and many others.

This package was put together by Eloy Paris <peloy@debian.org>
based on previous work by Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>, 
Andrew Howell <andrew@it.com.au> and Bruce Perens <bruce@pixar.com>
from sources found at <URL:ftp://samba.anu.edu.au/pub/samba>.

As of early in the samba-2.0.0alpha series, the Samba package for Debian
was split into the following packages:

- samba (the Samba server)
- smbclient (a LAN Manager client - like the ftp program)
- swat (Samba Web Administration Tool)
- smbfs (smbfs userland utilities for kernels > 2.0.x)
- samba-doc (Samba documentation).
