Instructions:	Preparing Samba Packages for UnixWare
===============================================================

We provide support only for current versions of UnixWare.

The file samba-2.2-uw7.patch is a patch file suitable for use
with the patch command as follows:

        # cd ../../../source
        # patch -p 0 -i ../packaging/Caldera/UnixWare/samba-2.2-uw7.patch

The files modified by this patch are:
    smbwrapper/smbw.c
    tdb/tdb.c
    utils/torture.c
    utils/locktest.c
    utils/locktest2.c
    utils/masktest.c
    utils/smbcacls.c
    ltconfig
    configure.in

This patch should only be necessary until these changes are accepted
back into the 2.2 source tree. Until then, this patch must be applied
prior to building Samba 2.2 on UnixWare 7. After applying the patch it
is then necessary to run autoconf again and regenerate the configure file:

        # cd ../../../source
        # autoconf

To produce the pkgadd installable datastream simply type (in this directory):
	# ./Makepkg

The resultant samba.pkg should reside in the ./dist subdirectory.
To install from this pkgadd datastream, issue the command (as root):

        # cd dist
        # pkgadd -d `pwd`/samba.pkg all

Alternately, each of the steps in building the datastream may be performed
individually by invoking each of the following:

        # ./Configure
        # ./Compile
        # ./Install
        # ./Package

If files are added or deleted from the UnixWare Samba distribution then
the prototype file in the pkg directory should be appropriately modified.
The files in the pkg subdirectory were initially created using the mkpkg
package from SCO Skunkware (see http://www.sco.com/skunkware).
