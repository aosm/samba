README for Samba Virtual File System (VFS) Examples
===================================================

This directory contains some sample code to demonstrate VFS
construction.  The following VFS modules are given:

	skel
		A skeleton VFS module.  When used, this module simply
		passes all requests back to the disk functions (i.e it
		operates as a passthrough filter).  It should be
		useful as a starting point for developing new VFS
		modules. 

	audit
		A simple module to audit file access to the syslog
		facility.  The following operations are logged: share
		connect/disconnect, directory opens/create/remove,
		file open/close/rename/unlink/chmod.

	block/

		A directory containing a sample module by Ronald Kuetemeier
		<ronald@kuetemeier.com> to block named symbolic link following.

The libtool program, available from your favourite GNU software
archive, is required to compile these programs.

To use the VFS modules, create a share similar to the one below.  The
important parameter is the 'vfs object' parameter which must point to
the exact pathname of the shared library object.

       [audit]
                comment = Audited /data directory
                path = /data
                vfs object = /path/to/audit.so
                writeable = yes
                browseable = yes

Further documentation on writing VFS modules for Samba can be found in
docs directory of the Samba source distribution.
