	drive letter or UNC path. When the menu pops-up, click 
	on the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Properties</I
> entry at the bottom of 
	the menu. This brings up the normal file properties dialog
	box, but with Samba 2.0.4 this will have a new tab along the top
	marked <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Security</I
>. Click on this tab and you 
	will see three buttons, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Permissions</I
>, 	
	<I

>Auditing</I
>, and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Ownership</I

	The <I

	an error message <SPAN
CLASS="ERRORNAME"
>A requested privilege is not held 
	by the client</SPAN
> to appear if the user is not the 
	NT Administrator, or a dialog which is intended to allow an 
	Administrator to add auditing requirements to a file if the 
	user is logged on as the NT Administrator. This dialog is 
	non-functional with a Samba share at this time, as the only 
	useful button, the <B

	allow a list of users to be seen.</P

	you to change the ownership of this file to yourself (clicking on 
	it will display a dialog box complaining that the user you are 
	currently logged onto the NT client cannot be found). The reason 
	for this is that changing the ownership of a file is a privileged 
	operation in UNIX, available only to the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>root</I
> 
	user. As clicking on this button causes NT to attempt to change 
	the ownership of a file to the current user logged into the NT 
	client this will not work with Samba at this time.</P
><P
>There is an NT chown command that will work with Samba 
	and allow a user with Administrator privilege connected 
	to a Samba 2.0.4 server as root to change the ownership of 
	files on both a local NTFS filesystem or remote mounted NTFS 
	or Samba drive. This is available as part of the <I

>The standard UNIX user/group/world triple and 
		the corresponding "read", "write", "execute" permissions 
		triples are mapped by Samba into a three element NT ACL 
		with the 'r', 'w', and 'x' bits mapped into the corresponding 
		NT permissions. The UNIX world permissions are mapped into 
		the global NT group <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>Everyone</B
>, followed 
		by the list of permissions allowed for UNIX world. The UNIX 
		owner and group permissions are displayed as an NT 
		<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

> icon and an NT <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>local 
		group</B
> icon respectively followed by the list 
	 	of permissions allowed for the UNIX user and group.</P
><P
>As many UNIX permission sets don't map into common 
		NT names such as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"read"</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>		"change"</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"full control"</B
> then 
		usually the permissions will be prefixed by the words <B

> in the NT display list.</P
><P
>But what happens if the file has no permissions allowed 
		for a particular UNIX user group or world component ? In order 
		to  allow "no permissions" to be seen and modified then Samba 
		overloads the NT <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"Take Ownership"</B
> ACL attribute 
		(which has no meaning in UNIX) and reports a component with 
		no permissions as having the NT <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"O"</B
> bit set. 
		This was chosen of course to make it look like a zero, meaning 
		zero permissions. More details on the decision behind this will 
		be given below.</P

		NT style. This first set of permissions is created by Samba in

	limitations that a user needs to be aware of, and also interactions 
	with the standard Samba permission masks and mapping of DOS

><P
>If the parameter <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"

><P
>The first thing to note is that the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"Add"</B
> 
	button will not return a list of users in Samba 2.0.4 (it will give 
	an error message of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"The remote procedure call failed 
	and did not execute"</B
>). This means that you can only 
	manipulate the current user/group/world permissions listed in 
	the dialog box. This actually works quite well as these are the 
	only permissions that UNIX actually has.</P
><P
>If a permission triple (either user, group, or world) 
	is removed from the list of permissions in the NT dialog box, 
	then when the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"OK"</B
> button is pressed it will 
	be applied as "no permissions" on the UNIX side. If you then 
	view the permissions again the "no permissions" entry will appear 
	as the NT <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"O"</B
> flag, as described above. This 
	allows you to add permissions back to a file or directory once 
	you have removed them from a triple component.</P
><P
>As UNIX supports only the "r", "w" and "x" bits of 
	an NT ACL then if other NT security attributes such as "Delete 
	access" are selected then they will be ignored when applied on 
	the Samba server.</P
><P
>When setting permissions on a directory the second 
	set of permissions (in the second set of parentheses) is 
	by default applied to all files within that directory. If this 
	is not what you want you must uncheck the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"Replace 
	permissions on existing files"</B
> checkbox in the NT 
	dialog before clicking <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"OK"</B
>.</P
><P
>If you wish to remove all permissions from a 
	user/group/world  component then you may either highlight the 
	component and click the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"Remove"</B
> button, 
	or set the component to only have the special <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>"Take
	Ownership"</B
