> The MSRPC over SMB code has 
	been developed from examining  Network traces. No documentation is 
	available from the original creators  (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over 
	SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC services  work. Microsoft's 
	implementation of these services has been demonstrated  (and reported) 
	to be... a bit flaky in places. </P
><P
>The development of Samba's implementation is also a bit rough, 
	and as more  of the services are understood, it can even result in 
	versions of  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd(8)</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rpcclient(1)</B
> 
	that are incompatible for some commands or  services. Additionally, 
	the developers are sending reports to Microsoft,  and problems found 
	or reported to Microsoft are fixed in Service Packs,  which may
