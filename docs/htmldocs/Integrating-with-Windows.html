></P
><P
>The purpose of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> is to provide a 
name resolution mechanism so that uses do not need to remember 
IP addresses.</P
><P
>Network packets that are sent over the physical network transport 
layer communicate not via IP addresses but rather using the Media 
Access Control address, or MAC address. IP Addresses are currently 
32 bits in length and are typically presented as four (4) decimal 
numbers that are separated by a dot (or period). eg: 168.192.1.1</P
><P
>MAC Addresses use 48 bits (or 6 bytes) and are typically represented 
as two digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. eg: 
40:8e:0a:12:34:56</P
><P
>Every network interfrace must have an MAC address. Associated with 
a MAC address there may be one or more IP addresses. There is NO 
relationship between an IP address and a MAC address, all such assignments 
are arbitary or discretionary in nature. At the most basic level all 
network communications takes place using MAC addressing. Since MAC 
addresses must be globally unique, and generally remains fixed for 
any particular interface, the assignment of an IP address makes sense 
from a network management perspective. More than one IP address can 
be assigned per MAC address. One address must be the primary IP address, 
this is the address that will be returned in the ARP reply.</P
><P
>When a user or a process wants to communicate with another machine 
the protocol implementation ensures that the "machine name" or "host 
name" is resolved to an IP address in a manner that is controlled 
by the TCP/IP configuration control files. The file 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> is one such file.</P
><P
>When the IP address of the destination interface has been 
determined a protocol called ARP/RARP isused to identify 
the MAC address of the target interface. ARP stands for Address 
Resolution Protocol, and is a broadcast oriented method that 
uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send a request to all 
interfaces on the local network segment using the all 1's MAC 
address. Network interfaces are programmed to respond to two 
MAC addresses only; their own unique address and the address 
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. The reply packet from an ARP request will 
contain the MAC address and the primary IP address for each 
interface.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> file is foundational to all 
Unix/Linux TCP/IP installations and as a minumum will contain 
the localhost and local network interface IP addresses and the 
primary names by which they are known within the local machine. 
This file helps to prime the pump so that a basic level of name 
resolution can exist before any other method of name resolution 
becomes available.</P

><P
>Samba version 2.2.0 will add Linux support for extensions to 
the name service switch infrastructure so that linux clients will 
be able to obtain resolution of MS Windows NetBIOS names to IP 
Addresses. To gain this functionality Samba needs to be compiled 
with appropriate arguments to the make command (ie: <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make 
nsswitch/libnss_wins.so</B
>). The resulting library should 
then be installed in the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib</TT
> directory and 
the "wins" parameter needs to be added to the "hosts:" line in 
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT
> file. At this point it 
will be possible to ping any MS Windows machine by it's NetBIOS 
machine name, so long as that machine is within the workgroup to 
which both the samba machine and the MS Windows machine belong.</P

NAME="AEN88"
>Name resolution as used within MS Windows networking</A
></H1
><P
>MS Windows networking is predicated about the name each machine 
is given. This name is known variously (and inconsistently) as 
the "computer name", "machine name", "networking name", "netbios name", 
"SMB name". All terms mean the same thing with the exception of 
"netbios name" which can apply also to the name of the workgroup or the 
domain name. The terms "workgroup" and "domain" are really just a 
simply name with which the machine is associated. All NetBIOS names 
are exactly 16 characters in length. The 16th character is reserved. 
It is used to store a one byte value that indicates service level 
information for the NetBIOS name that is registered. A NetBIOS machine 
name is therefore registered for each service type that is provided by 
the client/server.</P
><P
>The following are typical NetBIOS name/service type registrations:</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	Unique NetBIOS Names:
		MACHINENAME&#60;00&#62;	= Server Service is running on MACHINENAME
		MACHINENAME&#60;03&#62; = Generic Machine Name (NetBIOS name)
		MACHINENAME&#60;20&#62; = LanMan Server service is running on MACHINENAME
		WORKGROUP&#60;1b&#62; = Domain Master Browser

	Group Names:
		WORKGROUP&#60;03&#62; = Generic Name registered by all members of WORKGROUP
		WORKGROUP&#60;1c&#62; = Domain Controllers / Netlogon Servers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1d&#62; = Local Master Browsers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1e&#62; = Internet Name Resolvers</PRE
></P
><P
>It should be noted that all NetBIOS machines register their own 
names as per the above. This is in vast contrast to TCP/IP 
installations where traditionally the system administrator will 
determine in the /etc/hosts or in the DNS database what names 
are associated with each IP address.</P
><P
>One further point of clarification should be noted, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> 
file and the DNS records do not provide the NetBIOS name type information 
that MS Windows clients depend on to locate the type of service that may 
be needed. An example of this is what happens when an MS Windows client 
wants to locate a domain logon server. It find this service and the IP 
address of a server that provides it by performing a lookup (via a 
NetBIOS broadcast) for enumeration of all machines that have 
registered the name type *&#60;1c&#62;. A logon request is then sent to each 
IP address that is returned in the enumerated list of IP addresses. Which 
ever machine first replies then ends up providing the logon services.</P
><P
>The name "workgroup" or "domain" really can be confusing since these 
have the added significance of indicating what is the security 
architecture of the MS Windows network. The term "workgroup" indicates 
that the primary nature of the network environment is that of a 
peer-to-peer design. In a WORKGROUP all machines are responsible for 
their own security, and generally such security is limited to use of 
just a password (known as SHARE MORE security). In most situations 
with peer-to-peer networking the users who control their own machines 
will simply opt to have no security at all. It is possible to have 
USER MODE security in a WORKGROUP environment, thus requiring use 
of a user name and a matching password.</P
><P
>MS Windows networking is thus predetermined to use machine names 
for all local and remote machine message passing. The protocol used is 
called Server Message Block (SMB) and this is implemented using 
the NetBIOS protocol (Network Basic Input Output System). NetBIOS can 
be encapsulated using LLC (Logical Link Control) protocol - in which case 
the resulting protocol is called NetBEUI (Network Basic Extended User 
Interface). NetBIOS can also be run over IPX (Internetworking Packet 
Exchange) protocol as used by Novell NetWare, and it can be run 
over TCP/IP protocols - in which case the resulting protocol is called 
NBT or NetBT, the NetBIOS over TCP/IP.</P
><P
>MS Windows machines use a complex array of name resolution mechanisms. 
Since we are primarily concerned with TCP/IP this demonstration is 
limited to this area.</P

NAME="AEN100"
>The NetBIOS Name Cache</A
></H2
><P
>All MS Windows machines employ an in memory buffer in which is 
stored the NetBIOS names and their IP addresses for all external 
machines that that the local machine has communicated with over the 
past 10-15 minutes. It is more efficient to obtain an IP address 
for a machine from the local cache than it is to go through all the 
configured name resolution mechanisms.</P
><P
>If a machine whose name is in the local name cache has been shut 
down before the name had been expired and flushed from the cache, then 
an attempt to exchange a message with that machine will be subject 
to time-out delays. ie: It's name is in the cache, so a name resolution 
lookup will succeed, but the machine can not respond. This can be 
frustrating for users - but it is a characteristic of the protocol.</P
><P
>The MS Windows utility that allows examination of the NetBIOS 
name cache is called "nbtstat". The Samba equivalent of this 
is called "nmblookup".</P

CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>	# Copyright (c) 1998 Microsoft Corp.
	#
	# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft Wins Client (NetBIOS
	# over TCP/IP) stack for Windows98
	#
	# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to NT computernames
	# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line.
	# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
	# corresponding computername. The address and the comptername
	# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character
	# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions
	# below).
	#
	# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts
	# files and offers the following extensions:
	#
	#      #PRE
	#      #DOM:&lt;domain&gt;
	#      #INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;
	#      #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	#      #END_ALTERNATE
	#      \0xnn (non-printing character support)
	#
	# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause
	# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are
	# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.
	#
	# Following an entry with the "#DOM:&lt;domain&gt;" tag will associate the
	# entry with the domain specified by &lt;domain&gt;. This affects how the
	# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload
	# the host name associated with #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a
	# #PRE to the line. The &lt;domain&gt; is always preloaded although it will not
	# be shown when the name cache is viewed.
	#
	# Specifying "#INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)
	# software to seek the specified &lt;filename&gt; and parse it as if it were
	# local. &lt;filename&gt; is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a
	# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server.
	# It is ALWAYS necessary to provide a mapping for the IP address of the
	# server prior to the #INCLUDE. This mapping must use the #PRE directive.
	# In addtion the share "public" in the example below must be in the
	# LanManServer list of "NullSessionShares" in order for client machines to
	# be able to read the lmhosts file successfully. This key is under
	# \machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\nullsessionshares
	# in the registry. Simply add "public" to the list found there.
	#
	# The #BEGIN_ and #END_ALTERNATE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE
	# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include
	# will cause the group to succeed.
	#
	# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by
	# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the
	# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.
	#
	# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:
	#
	# 102.54.94.97     rhino         #PRE #DOM:networking  #net group's DC
	# 102.54.94.102    "appname  \0x14"                    #special app server
	# 102.54.94.123    popular            #PRE             #source server
	# 102.54.94.117    localsrv           #PRE             #needed for the include
	#
	# #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts
	# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts
	# #END_ALTERNATE
	#
	# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special
	# character in its name, the "popular" and "localsrv" server names are
	# preloaded, and the "rhino" server name is specified so it can be used
	# to later #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"
	# system is unavailable.
	#
	# Note that the whole file is parsed including comments on each lookup,
	# so keeping the number of comments to a minimum will improve performance.
	# Therefore it is not advisable to simply add lmhosts file entries onto the
	# end of this file.</PRE

><P
>As stated above, MS Windows machines register their NetBIOS names 
(ie: the machine name for each service type in operation) on start 
up. Also, as stated above, the exact method by which this name registration 
takes place is determined by whether or not the MS Windows client/server 
has been given a WINS server address, whether or not LMHOSTS lookup 
is enabled, or if DNS for NetBIOS name resolution is enabled, etc.</P
><P
>In the case where there is no WINS server all name registrations as 
well as name lookups are done by UDP broadcast. This isolates name 
resolution to the local subnet, unless LMHOSTS is used to list all 
names and IP addresses. In such situations Samba provides a means by 
which the samba server name may be forcibly injected into the browse 
list of a remote MS Windows network (using the "remote announce" parameter).</P
><P
>Where a WINS server is used, the MS Windows client will use UDP 
unicast to register with the WINS server. Such packets can be routed 
and thus WINS allows name resolution to function across routed networks.</P
><P
>During the startup process an election will take place to create a 
local master browser if one does not already exist. On each NetBIOS network 
one machine will be elected to function as the domain master browser. This 
domain browsing has nothing to do with MS security domain control. 
Instead, the domain master browser serves the role of contacting each local 
master browser (found by asking WINS or from LMHOSTS) and exchanging browse 
list contents. This way every master browser will eventually obtain a complete 
list of all machines that are on the network. Every 11-15 minutes an election 
is held to determine which machine will be the master browser. By nature of 
the election criteria used, the machine with the highest uptime, or the 
most senior protocol version, or other criteria, will win the election 
as domain master browser.</P
><P
>Clients wishing to browse the network make use of this list, but also depend 
on the availability of correct name resolution to the respective IP 
address/addresses. </P
><P
>Any configuration that breaks name resolution and/or browsing intrinsics 
will annoy users because they will have to put up with protracted 
inability to use the network services.</P
><P
>Samba supports a feature that allows forced synchonisation 
of browse lists across routed networks using the "remote 
browse sync" parameter in the smb.conf file. This causes Samba 
to contact the local master browser on a remote network and 
to request browse list synchronisation. This effectively bridges 
two networks that are separated by routers. The two remote 
networks may use either broadcast based name resolution or WINS 
based name resolution, but it should be noted that the "remote 
browse sync" parameter provides browse list synchronisation - and 
that is distinct from name to address resolution, in other 
words, for cross subnet browsing to function correctly it is 
essential that a name to address resolution mechanism be provided. 
This mechanism could be via DNS, <TT

has a mechanism by which the connection can be re-established using 
a cached copy of the password.</P

>When Microsoft changed the default password mode, they dropped support for 
caching of the plain text password. This means that when the registry 
parameter is changed to re-enable use of plain text passwords it appears to 
work, but when a dropped mapping attempts to revalidate it will fail if 
the remote authentication server does not support encrypted passwords. 
This means that it is definitely not a good idea to re-enable plain text 
password support in such clients.</P

characters.  This means that in order for a user on a Windows 9x
client to connect to a Samba server using clear text authentication,
the <TT

number of upper case letter which <I

DES version of crypt(), then a <TT

of 8 will result in case insensitive passwords as seen from Windows
users.  This will also result in longer login times as Samba
hash to compute the permutations of the password string and 
try them one by one until a match is located (or all combinations fail).</P

where ever Samba is used. There are three configuration possibilities

>There are two ways of identifying whether or not a username and 
password pair was valid or not. One uses the reply information provided 
as part of the authentication messaging process, the other uses 
just and error code.</P
><P
>The down-side of this mode of configuration is the fact that 
for security reasons Samba will send the password server a bogus 
username and a bogus password and if the remote server fails to 
reject the username and password pair then an alternative mode 
of identification of validation is used. Where a site uses password 
lock out after a certain number of failed authentication attempts 
this will result in user lockouts.</P

a standard Unix account for the user, this account can be blocked
