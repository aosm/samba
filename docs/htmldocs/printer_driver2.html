>Beginning with the 2.2.0 release, Samba supports 
the native Windows NT printing mechanisms implemented via 
MS-RPC (i.e. the SPOOLSS named pipe).  Previous versions of 
Samba only supported LanMan printing calls.</P
><P
>The additional functionality provided by the new 
SPOOLSS support includes:</P
><P

><UL
><LI
><P
>Support for downloading printer driver 
	files to Windows 95/98/NT/2000 clients upon demand.

></LI

><P
>Uploading of printer drivers via the 
	Windows NT Add Printer Wizard (APW) or the 
	Imprints tool set (refer to <A
HREF="http://imprints.sourceforge.net"

>). 
	</P
></LI

>Support for the native MS-RPC printing 
	calls such as StartDocPrinter, EnumJobs(), etc...  (See 
	the MSDN documentation at <A

></LI
><LI
><P
>Improved support for printer queue manipulation 
	through the use of an internal databases for spooled job 
	information</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>There has been some initial confusion about what all this means
and whether or not it is a requirement for printer drivers to be 
installed on a Samba host in order to support printing from Windows 
clients.  A bug existed in Samba 2.2.0 which made Windows NT/2000 clients 
require that the Samba server possess a valid driver for the printer.  
This is fixed in Samba 2.2.1 and once again, Windows NT/2000 clients
can use the local APW for installing drivers to be used with a Samba 
served printer.  This is the same behavior exhibited by Windows 9x clients.
As a side note, Samba does not use these drivers in any way to process 
spooled files.  They are utilized entirely by the clients.</P

>Previous versions of Samba recommended using a share named [printer$].  
This name was taken from the printer$ service created by Windows 9x 
clients when a printer was shared.  Windows 9x printer servers always have 
a printer$ service which provides read-only access via no 
password in order to support printer driver downloads.</P
><P
>However, the initial implementation allowed for a 
parameter named <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>printer driver location</I
></TT
> 
to be used on a per share basis to specify the location of 
the driver files associated with that printer.  Another 
parameter named <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>printer driver</I

> provided 
a means of defining the printer driver name to be sent to 
the client.</P
><P

is not necessary.  Of course, in a workgroup environment where

silly accounts and security, then configure the share for 
guest access.  You'll probably want to add <A

>A few closing comments for this section, it is possible 
on a Windows NT print server to have printers
listed in the Printers folder which are not shared.  Samba does
not make this distinction.  By definition, the only printers of
which Samba is aware are those which are specified as shares in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
>.</P
><P
>Another interesting side note is that Windows NT clients do
not use the SMB printer share, but rather can print directly 
to any printer on another Windows NT host using MS-RPC.  This
of course assumes that the printing client has the necessary
privileges on the remote host serving the printer.  The default
permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the "Print"
permissions to the "Everyone" well-known group.</P
