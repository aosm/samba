>Choosing the Protocol Level</A

>smb.conf</TT
> file. The default is 
		NT1 and that is the best for the vast majority of sites.</P
><P
>In older versions of Samba you may have found it 
		necessary to use COREPLUS. The limitations that led to 
		this have mostly been fixed. It is now less likely that you 
		will want to use less than LANMAN1. The only remaining advantage 
		of COREPLUS is that for some obscure reason WfWg preserves 
		the case of passwords in this protocol, whereas under LANMAN1, 
		LANMAN2 or NT1 it uppercases all passwords before sending them,
		forcing you to use the "password level=" option in some cases.</P
><P
>The main advantage of LANMAN2 and NT1 is support for 
		long filenames with some clients (eg: smbclient, Windows NT 
		or Win95). </P
><P
>See the smb.conf(5) manual page for more details.</P
><P
>Note: To support print queue reporting you may find 
		that you have to use TCP/IP as the default protocol under 
		WfWg. For some reason if you leave Netbeui as the default 
		it may break the print queue reporting on some systems. 
		It is presumably a WfWg bug.</P

>Locking</A
></H2
><P
>One area which sometimes causes trouble is locking.</P
><P
>There are two types of locking which need to be 
		performed by a SMB server. The first is "record locking" 
		which allows a client to lock a range of bytes in a open file. 
		The second is the "deny modes" that are specified when a file 
		is open.</P
><P
>Record locking semantics under Unix is very
		different from record locking under Windows. Versions
		of Samba before 2.2 have tried to use the native
		fcntl() unix system call to implement proper record
		locking between different Samba clients. This can not
		be fully correct due to several reasons. The simplest
		is the fact that a Windows client is allowed to lock a
		byte range up to 2^32 or 2^64, depending on the client
		OS. The unix locking only supports byte ranges up to
		2^31. So it is not possible to correctly satisfy a
		lock request above 2^31. There are many more
		differences, too many to be listed here.</P
><P
>Samba 2.2 and above implements record locking
		completely independent of the underlying unix
		system. If a byte range lock that the client requests
		happens to fall into the range 0-2^31, Samba hands
		this request down to the Unix system. All other locks
		can not be seen by unix anyway.</P
><P
>Strictly a SMB server should check for locks before 
		every read and write call on a file. Unfortunately with the 
		way fcntl() works this can be slow and may overstress the 
		rpc.lockd. It is also almost always unnecessary as clients 
		are supposed to independently make locking calls before reads 
		and writes anyway if locking is important to them. By default 
		Samba only makes locking calls when explicitly asked
		to by a client, but if you set "strict locking = yes" then it will
		make lock checking calls on every read and write. </P
><P
>You can also disable by range locking completely 
		using "locking = no". This is useful for those shares that 
		don't support locking or don't need it (such as cdroms). In 
		this case Samba fakes the return codes of locking calls to 
		tell clients that everything is OK.</P
><P
>The second class of locking is the "deny modes". These 
		are set by an application when it opens a file to determine 
		what types of access should be allowed simultaneously with 
		its open. A client may ask for DENY_NONE, DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE 
		or DENY_ALL. There are also special compatibility modes called 
		DENY_FCB and  DENY_DOS.</P
><P
>You can disable share modes using "share modes = no". 
		This may be useful on a heavily loaded server as the share 
		modes code is very slow. See also the FAST_SHARE_MODES 
		option in the Makefile for a way to do full share modes 
		very fast using shared memory (if your OS supports it).</P
