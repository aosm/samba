>With the development of LanManager and Windows NT 
	compatible password encryption for Samba, it is now able 
	to validate user connections in exactly the same way as 
	a LanManager or Windows NT server.</P
><P
>This document describes how the SMB password encryption 
	algorithm works and what issues there are in choosing whether 
	you want to use it. You should read it carefully, especially 
	the part about security and the "PROS and CONS" section.</P

>How does it work?</A
></H1
><P
>LanManager encryption is somewhat similar to UNIX 
	password encryption. The server uses a file containing a 
	hashed value of a user's password.  This is created by taking 
	the user's plaintext password, capitalising it, and either 
	truncating to 14 bytes or padding to 14 bytes with null bytes. 
	This 14 byte value is used as two 56 bit DES keys to encrypt 
	a 'magic' eight byte value, forming a 16 byte value which is 
	stored by the server and client. Let this value be known as 
	the "hashed password".</P
><P
>Windows NT encryption is a higher quality mechanism, 
	consisting of doing an MD4 hash on a Unicode version of the user's 
	password. This also produces a 16 byte hash value that is 
	non-reversible.</P
><P
>When a client (LanManager, Windows for WorkGroups, Windows 
	95 or Windows NT) wishes to mount a Samba drive (or use a Samba 
	resource), it first requests a connection and negotiates the 
	protocol that the client and server will use. In the reply to this 
	request the Samba server generates and appends an 8 byte, random 
	value - this is stored in the Samba server after the reply is sent 
	and is known as the "challenge".  The challenge is different for 
	every client connection.</P
><P
>The client then uses the hashed password (16 byte values 
	described above), appended with 5 null bytes, as three 56 bit 
	DES keys, each of which is used to encrypt the challenge 8 byte 
	value, forming a 24 byte value known as the "response".</P
><P
>In the SMB call SMBsessionsetupX (when user level security 
	is selected) or the call SMBtconX (when share level security is 
	selected), the 24 byte response is returned by the client to the 
	Samba server.  For Windows NT protocol levels the above calculation 
	is done on both hashes of the user's password and both responses are 
	returned in the SMB call, giving two 24 byte values.</P
><P
>The Samba server then reproduces the above calculation, using 
	its own stored value of the 16 byte hashed password (read from the 
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd</TT
> file - described later) and the challenge 
	value that it kept from the negotiate protocol reply. It then checks 
	to see if the 24 byte value it calculates matches the 24 byte value 
	returned to it from the client.</P
><P
>If these values match exactly, then the client knew the 
	correct password (or the 16 byte hashed value - see security note 
	below) and is thus allowed access. If not, then the client did not 
	know the correct password and is denied access.</P
><P
>Note that the Samba server never knows or stores the cleartext 
	of the user's password - just the 16 byte hashed values derived from 
	it. Also note that the cleartext password or 16 byte hashed values 
	are never transmitted over the network - thus increasing security.</P

><P
>The unix and SMB password encryption techniques seem similar 
	on the surface. This similarity is, however, only skin deep. The unix 
	scheme typically sends clear text passwords over the network when 
	logging in. This is bad. The SMB encryption scheme never sends the 
	cleartext password over the network but it does store the 16 byte 
	hashed values on disk. This is also bad. Why? Because the 16 byte hashed 
	values are a "password equivalent". You cannot derive the user's 
	password from them, but they could potentially be used in a modified 
	client to gain access to a server. This would require considerable 
	technical knowledge on behalf of the attacker but is perfectly possible. 
	You should thus treat the smbpasswd file as though it contained the 
	cleartext passwords of all your users. Its contents must be kept 
	secret, and the file should be protected accordingly.</P
><P
>Ideally we would like a password scheme which neither requires 
	plain text passwords on the net or on disk. Unfortunately this 
	is not available as Samba is stuck with being compatible with 
	other SMB systems (WinNT, WfWg, Win95 etc). </P

>In order for Samba to participate in the above protocol 
	it must be able to look up the 16 byte hashed values given a user name.
	Unfortunately, as the UNIX password value is also a one way hash
	function (ie. it is impossible to retrieve the cleartext of the user's
	password given the UNIX hash of it), a separate password file
	containing this 16 byte value must be kept. To minimise problems with
	these two password files, getting out of sync, the UNIX <TT

>When the password file is created all users have password entries
	consisting of 32 'X' characters. By default this disallows any access

	representation of the 16 byte hashed value of a user's password.</P

><P
>If you are allowing users to use the smbpasswd command to set 
	their own passwords, you may want to give users NO PASSWORD initially 
	so they do not have to enter a previous password when changing to their 
	new password (not recommended). In order for you to allow this the
