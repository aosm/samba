	If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd 
	utility, make sure that the account name is the machine netbios name 
	with a '$' appended to it ( ie. computer_name$ ). There must be an entry 
	in both /etc/passwd and the smbpasswd file. Some people have reported

></H2
><P
>	This was the only option until recently, now in version 2.2 better 
	means are available.  You might still need to do it manually for a 
	couple of reasons. A machine account consists of two entries (assuming 
	a standard install and /etc/passwd use), one in /etc/passwd and the 
	other in /usr/local/samba/private/smbpasswd. The /etc/passwd
	entry will list the machine name with a $ appended, won't have a 
	passwd, will have a null shell and no home directory. For example 
	a machine called 'doppy' would have an /etc/passwd entry like this :</P
><P
>	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>doppy$:x:505:501:NTMachine:/dev/null:/bin/false</B
>
	</P
><P
>	On a linux system for example, you would typically add it like 
	this :
	</P
><P
>	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>adduser -g machines -c NTMachine -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -n 
	doppy$</B
>
	</P
><P
>	Then you need to add that entry to smbpasswd, assuming you have a suitable
	path to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbpasswd</B
> program, do this :
	</P
><P
>	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbpasswd -a -m doppy$</B
>
	</P
><P
>	The entry will be created with a well known password, so any machine that 
	says it's doppy could join the domain as long as it gets in first. So 
	don't create the accounts any earlier than you need them.

>	One of the best diagnostic tools for debugging problems is Samba itself.  
	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</P
><P
>	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -g </B
> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.
