		the case of passwords in this protocol, whereas under LANMAN1, 
		LANMAN2 or NT1 it uppercases all passwords before sending them,
		forcing you to use the "password level=" option in some cases.</P

>1.10.5. Locking</A
></H2
><P
>One area which sometimes causes trouble is locking.</P
><P
>There are two types of locking which need to be 
		performed by a SMB server. The first is "record locking" 
		which allows a client to lock a range of bytes in a open file. 
		The second is the "deny modes" that are specified when a file 
		is open.</P
><P
>Record locking semantics under Unix is very
		different from record locking under Windows. Versions
		of Samba before 2.2 have tried to use the native
		fcntl() unix system call to implement proper record
		locking between different Samba clients. This can not
		be fully correct due to several reasons. The simplest
		is the fact that a Windows client is allowed to lock a
		byte range up to 2^32 or 2^64, depending on the client
		OS. The unix locking only supports byte ranges up to
		2^31. So it is not possible to correctly satisfy a
		lock request above 2^31. There are many more
		differences, too many to be listed here.</P
><P
>Samba 2.2 and above implements record locking
		completely independent of the underlying unix
		system. If a byte range lock that the client requests
		happens to fall into the range 0-2^31, Samba hands
		this request down to the Unix system. All other locks
		can not be seen by unix anyway.</P
><P
>Strictly a SMB server should check for locks before 
		every read and write call on a file. Unfortunately with the 
		way fcntl() works this can be slow and may overstress the 
		rpc.lockd. It is also almost always unnecessary as clients 
		are supposed to independently make locking calls before reads 
		and writes anyway if locking is important to them. By default 
		Samba only makes locking calls when explicitly asked
		to by a client, but if you set "strict locking = yes" then it will
		make lock checking calls on every read and write. </P
><P
>You can also disable by range locking completely 
		using "locking = no". This is useful for those shares that 
		don't support locking or don't need it (such as cdroms). In 
		this case Samba fakes the return codes of locking calls to 
		tell clients that everything is OK.</P
><P
>The second class of locking is the "deny modes". These 
		are set by an application when it opens a file to determine 
		what types of access should be allowed simultaneously with 
		its open. A client may ask for DENY_NONE, DENY_READ, DENY_WRITE 
		or DENY_ALL. There are also special compatibility modes called 
		DENY_FCB and  DENY_DOS.</P
><P
>You can disable share modes using "share modes = no". 
		This may be useful on a heavily loaded server as the share 
		modes code is very slow. See also the FAST_SHARE_MODES 
		option in the Makefile for a way to do full share modes 
		very fast using shared memory (if your OS supports it).</P

>The purpose of <TT

>/etc/hosts</TT
> is to provide a 
name resolution mechanism so that uses do not need to remember 
IP addresses.</P
><P
>Network packets that are sent over the physical network transport 
layer communicate not via IP addresses but rather using the Media 
Access Control address, or MAC address. IP Addresses are currently 
32 bits in length and are typically presented as four (4) decimal 
numbers that are separated by a dot (or period). eg: 168.192.1.1</P
><P
>MAC Addresses use 48 bits (or 6 bytes) and are typically represented 
as two digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons. eg: 
40:8e:0a:12:34:56</P
><P
>Every network interfrace must have an MAC address. Associated with 
a MAC address there may be one or more IP addresses. There is NO 
relationship between an IP address and a MAC address, all such assignments 
are arbitary or discretionary in nature. At the most basic level all 
network communications takes place using MAC addressing. Since MAC 
addresses must be globally unique, and generally remains fixed for 
any particular interface, the assignment of an IP address makes sense 
from a network management perspective. More than one IP address can 
be assigned per MAC address. One address must be the primary IP address, 
this is the address that will be returned in the ARP reply.</P
><P
>When a user or a process wants to communicate with another machine 
the protocol implementation ensures that the "machine name" or "host 
name" is resolved to an IP address in a manner that is controlled 
by the TCP/IP configuration control files. The file 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> is one such file.</P
><P
>When the IP address of the destination interface has been 
determined a protocol called ARP/RARP isused to identify 
the MAC address of the target interface. ARP stands for Address 
Resolution Protocol, and is a broadcast oriented method that 
uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to send a request to all 
interfaces on the local network segment using the all 1's MAC 
address. Network interfaces are programmed to respond to two 
MAC addresses only; their own unique address and the address 
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. The reply packet from an ARP request will 
contain the MAC address and the primary IP address for each 
interface.</P
><P
>The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> file is foundational to all 
Unix/Linux TCP/IP installations and as a minumum will contain

>2.3. Name resolution as used within MS Windows networking</A

><P
>MS Windows networking is predicated about the name each machine 
is given. This name is known variously (and inconsistently) as 
the "computer name", "machine name", "networking name", "netbios name", 
"SMB name". All terms mean the same thing with the exception of 
"netbios name" which can apply also to the name of the workgroup or the 
domain name. The terms "workgroup" and "domain" are really just a 
simply name with which the machine is associated. All NetBIOS names 
are exactly 16 characters in length. The 16th character is reserved. 
It is used to store a one byte value that indicates service level 
information for the NetBIOS name that is registered. A NetBIOS machine 
name is therefore registered for each service type that is provided by 
the client/server.</P
><P

		MACHINENAME&#60;20&#62; = LanMan Server service is running on MACHINENAME
		WORKGROUP&#60;1b&#62; = Domain Master Browser

	Group Names:
		WORKGROUP&#60;03&#62; = Generic Name registered by all members of WORKGROUP
		WORKGROUP&#60;1c&#62; = Domain Controllers / Netlogon Servers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1d&#62; = Local Master Browsers
		WORKGROUP&#60;1e&#62; = Internet Name Resolvers</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
></P
><P
>It should be noted that all NetBIOS machines register their own 
names as per the above. This is in vast contrast to TCP/IP 
installations where traditionally the system administrator will 
determine in the /etc/hosts or in the DNS database what names 
are associated with each IP address.</P
><P
>One further point of clarification should be noted, the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/hosts</TT
> 
file and the DNS records do not provide the NetBIOS name type information 
that MS Windows clients depend on to locate the type of service that may 
be needed. An example of this is what happens when an MS Windows client 
wants to locate a domain logon server. It find this service and the IP 
address of a server that provides it by performing a lookup (via a 
NetBIOS broadcast) for enumeration of all machines that have 
registered the name type *&#60;1c&#62;. A logon request is then sent to each 
IP address that is returned in the enumerated list of IP addresses. Which 
ever machine first replies then ends up providing the logon services.</P
><P
>The name "workgroup" or "domain" really can be confusing since these 
have the added significance of indicating what is the security 
architecture of the MS Windows network. The term "workgroup" indicates 
that the primary nature of the network environment is that of a 
peer-to-peer design. In a WORKGROUP all machines are responsible for 
their own security, and generally such security is limited to use of 
just a password (known as SHARE MORE security). In most situations 
with peer-to-peer networking the users who control their own machines 
will simply opt to have no security at all. It is possible to have 
USER MODE security in a WORKGROUP environment, thus requiring use 
of a user name and a matching password.</P
><P
>MS Windows networking is thus predetermined to use machine names 
for all local and remote machine message passing. The protocol used is 
called Server Message Block (SMB) and this is implemented using 
the NetBIOS protocol (Network Basic Input Output System). NetBIOS can 
be encapsulated using LLC (Logical Link Control) protocol - in which case 
the resulting protocol is called NetBEUI (Network Basic Extended User 
Interface). NetBIOS can also be run over IPX (Internetworking Packet 
Exchange) protocol as used by Novell NetWare, and it can be run 
over TCP/IP protocols - in which case the resulting protocol is called 
NBT or NetBT, the NetBIOS over TCP/IP.</P

Since we are primarily concerned with TCP/IP this demonstration is 
limited to this area.</P

stored the NetBIOS names and their IP addresses for all external 
machines that that the local machine has communicated with over the 
past 10-15 minutes. It is more efficient to obtain an IP address 
for a machine from the local cache than it is to go through all the 
configured name resolution mechanisms.</P
><P
>If a machine whose name is in the local name cache has been shut 
down before the name had been expired and flushed from the cache, then 
an attempt to exchange a message with that machine will be subject 
to time-out delays. ie: It's name is in the cache, so a name resolution 
lookup will succeed, but the machine can not respond. This can be 
frustrating for users - but it is a characteristic of the protocol.</P

	#
	# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft Wins Client (NetBIOS
	# over TCP/IP) stack for Windows98
	#
	# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to NT computernames
	# (NetBIOS) names.  Each entry should be kept on an individual line.
	# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the
	# corresponding computername. The address and the comptername
	# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character
	# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions
	# below).
	#
	# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts
	# files and offers the following extensions:
	#
	#      #PRE
	#      #DOM:&#60;domain&#62;
	#      #INCLUDE &#60;filename&#62;
	#      #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	#      #END_ALTERNATE
	#      \0xnn (non-printing character support)
	#
	# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause
	# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are
	# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.
	#
	# Following an entry with the "#DOM:&#60;domain&#62;" tag will associate the
	# entry with the domain specified by &#60;domain&#62;. This affects how the
	# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload
	# the host name associated with #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a
	# #PRE to the line. The &#60;domain&#62; is always preloaded although it will not
	# be shown when the name cache is viewed.
	#
	# Specifying "#INCLUDE &#60;filename&#62;" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)
	# software to seek the specified &#60;filename&#62; and parse it as if it were
	# local. &#60;filename&#62; is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a
	# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server.
	# It is ALWAYS necessary to provide a mapping for the IP address of the
	# server prior to the #INCLUDE. This mapping must use the #PRE directive.
	# In addtion the share "public" in the example below must be in the
	# LanManServer list of "NullSessionShares" in order for client machines to
	# be able to read the lmhosts file successfully. This key is under
	# \machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\nullsessionshares
	# in the registry. Simply add "public" to the list found there.
	#
	# The #BEGIN_ and #END_ALTERNATE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE
	# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include
	# will cause the group to succeed.
	#
	# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by
	# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the
	# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.
	#
	# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:
	#
	# 102.54.94.97     rhino         #PRE #DOM:networking  #net group's DC
	# 102.54.94.102    "appname  \0x14"                    #special app server
	# 102.54.94.123    popular            #PRE             #source server
	# 102.54.94.117    localsrv           #PRE             #needed for the include
	#
	# #BEGIN_ALTERNATE
	# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts
	# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts
	# #END_ALTERNATE
	#
	# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special
	# character in its name, the "popular" and "localsrv" server names are
	# preloaded, and the "rhino" server name is specified so it can be used
	# to later #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"
	# system is unavailable.
	#
	# Note that the whole file is parsed including comments on each lookup,
	# so keeping the number of comments to a minimum will improve performance.
	# Therefore it is not advisable to simply add lmhosts file entries onto the
	# end of this file.</PRE

><P
>As stated above, MS Windows machines register their NetBIOS names 
(ie: the machine name for each service type in operation) on start 
up. Also, as stated above, the exact method by which this name registration 
takes place is determined by whether or not the MS Windows client/server 
has been given a WINS server address, whether or not LMHOSTS lookup 
is enabled, or if DNS for NetBIOS name resolution is enabled, etc.</P
><P
>In the case where there is no WINS server all name registrations as 
well as name lookups are done by UDP broadcast. This isolates name 
resolution to the local subnet, unless LMHOSTS is used to list all 
names and IP addresses. In such situations Samba provides a means by 
which the samba server name may be forcibly injected into the browse 
list of a remote MS Windows network (using the "remote announce" parameter).</P
><P
>Where a WINS server is used, the MS Windows client will use UDP 
unicast to register with the WINS server. Such packets can be routed 
and thus WINS allows name resolution to function across routed networks.</P
><P
>During the startup process an election will take place to create a 
local master browser if one does not already exist. On each NetBIOS network 
one machine will be elected to function as the domain master browser. This 
domain browsing has nothing to do with MS security domain control. 
Instead, the domain master browser serves the role of contacting each local 
master browser (found by asking WINS or from LMHOSTS) and exchanging browse 
list contents. This way every master browser will eventually obtain a complete 
list of all machines that are on the network. Every 11-15 minutes an election 
is held to determine which machine will be the master browser. By nature of 
the election criteria used, the machine with the highest uptime, or the 
most senior protocol version, or other criteria, will win the election 
as domain master browser.</P
><P
>Clients wishing to browse the network make use of this list, but also depend 
on the availability of correct name resolution to the respective IP 
address/addresses. </P
><P
>Any configuration that breaks name resolution and/or browsing intrinsics 
will annoy users because they will have to put up with protracted 
inability to use the network services.</P
><P
>Samba supports a feature that allows forced synchonisation 
of browse lists across routed networks using the "remote 
browse sync" parameter in the smb.conf file. This causes Samba 
to contact the local master browser on a remote network and 
to request browse list synchronisation. This effectively bridges 
two networks that are separated by routers. The two remote 
networks may use either broadcast based name resolution or WINS 
based name resolution, but it should be noted that the "remote 
browse sync" parameter provides browse list synchronisation - and 
that is distinct from name to address resolution, in other 
words, for cross subnet browsing to function correctly it is 
essential that a name to address resolution mechanism be provided. 
This mechanism could be via DNS, <TT

and so on.</P

have been idle for 10 minutes or longer. When the user attempts to 
use the mapped drive connection that has been dropped the SMB protocol 
has a mechanism by which the connection can be re-established using 
a cached copy of the password.</P

>When Microsoft changed the default password mode, they dropped support for 
caching of the plain text password. This means that when the registry 
parameter is changed to re-enable use of plain text passwords it appears to 
work, but when a dropped mapping attempts to revalidate it will fail if 
the remote authentication server does not support encrypted passwords. 
This means that it is definitely not a good idea to re-enable plain text 
password support in such clients.</P

>A number of Unix systems (eg: Sun Solaris), as well as the 
xxxxBSD family and Linux, now utilize the Pluggable Authentication 
Modules (PAM) facility to provide all authentication, 
authorization and resource control services. Prior to the 
introduction of PAM, a decision to use an alternative to 
the system password database (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
>) 
would require the provision of alternatives for all programs that provide 
security services. Such a choice would involve provision of 
alternatives to such programs as: <B

>login</B

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd</B
>, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>chown</B
>, etc.</P
><P
>PAM provides a mechanism that disconnects these security programs 
from the underlying authentication/authorization infrastructure.
PAM is configured either through one file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.conf</TT

or by editing individual files that are located in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d</TT
>.</P

by commenting them out except the calls to <TT

></LI

><P
>There has been some initial confusion about what all this means
and whether or not it is a requirement for printer drivers to be 
installed on a Samba host in order to support printing from Windows 
clients.  A bug existed in Samba 2.2.0 which made Windows NT/2000 clients 
require that the Samba server possess a valid driver for the printer.  
This is fixed in Samba 2.2.1 and once again, Windows NT/2000 clients
can use the local APW for installing drivers to be used with a Samba 
served printer.  This is the same behavior exhibited by Windows 9x clients.
As a side note, Samba does not use these drivers in any way to process 
spooled files.  They are utilized entirely by the clients.</P

listed in the Printers folder which are not shared.  Samba does
not make this distinction.  By definition, the only printers of
which Samba is aware are those which are specified as shares in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smb.conf</TT
>.</P
><P
>Another interesting side note is that Windows NT clients do
not use the SMB printer share, but rather can print directly 
to any printer on another Windows NT host using MS-RPC.  This
of course assumes that the printing client has the necessary
privileges on the remote host serving the printer.  The default
permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the "Print"
permissions to the "Everyone" well-known group.</P

a Windows 2000 Domain.  Samba 2.2 is able to act as a member server of a Windows
2000 domain operating in mixed or native mode.</P
><P
>There is much confusion between the circumstances that require a "mixed" mode
Win2k DC and a when this host can be switched to "native" mode.  A "mixed" mode
Win2k domain controller is only needed if Windows NT BDCs must exist in the same
domain.  By default, a Win2k DC in "native" mode will still support
NetBIOS and NTLMv1 for authentication of legacy clients such as Windows 9x and 
NT 4.0.  Samba has the same requirements as a Windows NT 4.0 member server.</P

	having to create local Unix users to represent the users attaching 
	to your server. This means that if domain user <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOM\fred
	</TT
> attaches to your domain security Samba server, there needs 
	to be a local Unix user fred to represent that user in the Unix 
	filesystem. This is very similar to the older Samba security mode 
	<A
HREF="smb.conf.5.html#SECURITYEQUALSSERVER"
TARGET="_top"
>security = server</A
>, 
	where Samba would pass through the authentication request to a Windows 
	NT server in the same way as a Windows 95 or Windows 98 server would.
	</P
><P
>Please refer to the <A
HREF="winbind.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Winbind 
	paper</A
> for information on a system to automatically
	assign UNIX uids and gids to Windows NT Domain users and groups.
	This code is available in development branches only at the moment,
	but will be moved to release branches soon.</P
><P
>The advantage to domain-level security is that the 
	authentication in domain-level security is passed down the authenticated 
	RPC channel in exactly the same way that an NT server would do it. This 
	means Samba servers now participate in domain trust relationships in 
	exactly the same way NT servers do (i.e., you can add Samba servers into 
	a resource domain and have the authentication passed on from a resource
	domain PDC to an account domain PDC.</P
><P
>In addition, with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>security = server</B
> every Samba 
	daemon on a server has to keep a connection open to the 
	authenticating server for as long as that daemon lasts. This can drain 
	the connection resources on a Microsoft NT server and cause it to run 
	out of available connections. With <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>security = domain</B
>, 
	however, the Samba daemons connect to the PDC/BDC only for as long 
	as is necessary to authenticate the user, and then drop the connection, 
	thus conserving PDC connection resources.</P
><P
>And finally, acting in the same manner as an NT server 
	authenticating to a PDC means that as part of the authentication 
	reply, the Samba server gets the user identification information such 
	as the user SID, the list of NT groups the user belongs to, etc. All 
	this information will allow Samba to be extended in the future into 
	a mode the developers currently call appliance mode. In this mode, 
	no local Unix users will be necessary, and Samba will generate Unix 
	uids and gids from the information passed back from the PDC when a 
	user is authenticated, making a Samba server truly plug and play 
	in an NT domain environment. Watch for this code soon.</P

>Versions of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to act
as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller

(PDC).  With Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official support for
Windows NT 4.0-style domain logons from Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 
2000 clients.  This article outlines the steps
necessary for configuring Samba as a PDC.  It is necessary to have a
working Samba server prior to implementing the PDC functionality.  If
you have not followed the steps outlined in <A

>A machine trust account is a Samba account that is used to
authenticate a client machine (rather than a user) to the Samba
server.  In Windows terminology, this is known as a "Computer
Account."</P
><P
>The password of a machine trust account acts as the shared secret for
secure communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security
feature to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name
from joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group
accounts.  Windows NT and 2000 clients use machine trust accounts, but
Windows 9x clients do not.  Hence, a Windows 9x client is never a true
member of a domain because it does not possess a machine trust
account, and thus has no shared secret with the domain controller.</P
><P
>A Windows PDC stores each machine trust account in the Windows
Registry.  A Samba PDC, however, stores each machine trust account 
in two parts, as follows:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>A Samba account, stored in the same location as user
    LanMan and NT password hashes (currently
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd</TT
>). The Samba account 
    possesses and uses only the NT password hash.</P
></LI

>A corresponding Unix account, typically stored in
    <TT

	</P

>	One of the best diagnostic tools for debugging problems is Samba itself.  
	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</P
><P
>	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>gcc -g </B
> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

>A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).</P
><P
>The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is totally orthogonal to logon support.</P
><P
>Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients
which will be the focus of this section.</P
><P
>When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.</P
><P
>Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.</P

worthwhile lookingat how a Windows 9x/ME client performs a logon:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN&#60;1c&#62; at the
	NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).

	of the user's logon script. 
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this 	
	and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the

mode security.  <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>DOMAIN</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="CONSTANT"
>SERVER</TT
>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.</P
><P
>Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.</P
><P
>Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now 
in order to operate in domain mode security, the "workgroup" parameter
must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already 
has a domain controller, right?)</P
><P
>Therefore configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that 
already by definition has a PDC is asking for trouble.
Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC to be the DMB
for its domain.</P

The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.</P
><P
>Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.</P
><P
>To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.</P
><P
>The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT\&#62;</TT
> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config</P
><P
>The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>C:\WINNT&#62;</TT
>echo %SystemRoot%</P
><P
>The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.</P
><P
>In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.</P
><P
>The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.</P
><P
>The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.</P
><P
>Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.</P
><P
>The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (i.e. to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).</P
><P
>The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.</P
><P
>Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. Almost every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).</P
><P
>The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.</P

>What is a Domain Controller? It is a machine that is able to answer
logon requests from workstations in a Windows NT Domain. Whenever a
user logs into a Windows NT Workstation, the workstation connects to a
Domain Controller and asks him whether the username and password the
user typed in is correct.  The Domain Controller replies with a lot of
information about the user, for example the place where the users
profile is stored, the users full name of the user. All this
information is stored in the NT user database, the so-called SAM.</P
><P
>There are two kinds of Domain Controller in a NT 4 compatible Domain:
A Primary Domain Controller (PDC) and one or more Backup Domain
Controllers (BDC). The PDC contains the master copy of the
SAM. Whenever the SAM has to change, for example when a user changes
his password, this change has to be done on the PDC. A Backup Domain
Controller is a machine that maintains a read-only copy of the
SAM. This way it is able to reply to logon requests and authenticate
users in case the PDC is not available. During this time no changes to
the SAM are possible. Whenever changes to the SAM are done on the PDC,
all BDC receive the changes from the PDC.</P
><P
>Since version 2.2 Samba officially supports domain logons for all
current Windows Clients, including Windows 2000 and XP. This text
assumes the domain to be named SAMBA. To be able to act as a PDC, some
parameters in the [global]-section of the smb.conf have to be set:</P

NetBIOS name SAMBA#1b with the WINS server. The name type #1b is
normally reserved for the domain master browser, a role that has
nothing to do with anything related to authentication, but the
Microsoft Domain implementation requires the domain master browser to
be on the same machine as the PDC.</P

domain controller and can answer logon requests. To not open security
holes both the workstation and the selected (TODO: How is the DC

so the MACHINE.SID has to be copied from the PDC to the BDC.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Unix user database has to be synchronized from the PDC to the
BDC. This means that both the /etc/passwd and /etc/group have to be
replicated from the PDC to the BDC. This can be done manually
whenever changes are made, or the PDC is set up as a NIS master
server and the BDC as a NIS slave server. To set up the BDC as a
mere NIS client would not be enough, as the BDC would not be able to
access its user database in case of a PDC failure.</P

problem as the name SAMBA#1c is a NetBIOS group name that is meant to
be registered by more than one machine. The parameter 'domain master =
no' forces the BDC not to register SAMBA#1b which as a unique NetBIOS

><P
>As the smbpasswd file contains plain text password equivalents, it
must not be sent unencrypted over the wire. The best way to set up
smbpasswd replication from the PDC to the BDC is to use the utility
rsync. rsync can use ssh as a transport. ssh itself can be set up to

such as is used in databases.</P

><P
>As a result of these defeciencies, a more robust means of storing user attributes
used by smbd was developed.  The API which defines access to user accounts
is commonly referred to as the samdb interface (previously this was called the passdb
API, and is still so named in the CVS trees). In Samba 2.2.3, enabling support
for a samdb backend (e.g. <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-tdbsam</I

><P
>When compiling Samba to include the <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>--with-ldapsam</I
></TT
> autoconf
option, smbd (and associated tools) will store and lookup user accounts in
an LDAP directory.  In reality, this is very easy to understand.  If you are
comfortable with using an smbpasswd file, simply replace "smbpasswd" with
"LDAP directory" in all the documentation.</P
><P
>There are a few points to stress about what the <TT

>Just as the smbpasswd file is mean to store information which supplements a

<TT

in the directory.  However, there are several fields (e.g. uid) which overlap
with the posixAccount objectclass outlined in RFC2307.  This is by design.</P
><P
>In order to store all user account information (UNIX and Samba) in the directory,
it is necessary to use the sambaAccount and posixAccount objectclasses in
combination.  However, smbd will still obtain the user's UNIX account
information via the standard C library calls (e.g. getpwnam(), et. al.).
This means that the Samba server must also have the LDAP NSS library installed
and functioning correctly.  This division of information makes it possible to
store all Samba account information in LDAP, but still maintain UNIX account
information in NIS while the network is transitioning to a full LDAP infrastructure.</P

>11.3. What Winbind Provides</A
></H1
><P
>Winbind unifies UNIX and Windows NT account management by 
	allowing a UNIX box to become a full member of a NT domain. Once 
	this is done the UNIX box will see NT users and groups as if 
	they were native UNIX users and groups, allowing the NT domain 
	to be used in much the same manner that NIS+ is used within 
	UNIX-only environments.</P
><P
>The end result is that whenever any 
	program on the UNIX machine asks the operating system to lookup 
	a user or group name, the query will be resolved by asking the 
	NT domain controller for the specified domain to do the lookup.
	Because Winbind hooks into the operating system at a low level 
	(via the NSS name resolution modules in the C library) this 
	redirection to the NT domain controller is completely 
	transparent.</P
><P
>Users on the UNIX machine can then use NT user and group 
	names as they would use "native" UNIX names. They can chown files 
	so that they are owned by NT domain users or even login to the 
	UNIX machine and run a UNIX X-Window session as a domain user.</P
><P
>The only obvious indication that Winbind is being used is 
	that user and group names take the form DOMAIN\user and 
	DOMAIN\group. This is necessary as it allows Winbind to determine 
	that redirection to a domain controller is wanted for a particular 
	lookup and which trusted domain is being referenced.</P
><P
>Additionally, Winbind provides an authentication service 
	that hooks into the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system 
	to provide authentication via a NT domain to any PAM enabled 
	applications. This capability solves the problem of synchronizing 
	passwords between systems since all passwords are stored in a single 
	location (on the domain controller).</P

></H2
><P
>Over the last two years, efforts have been underway 
		by various Samba Team members to decode various aspects of 
		the Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) system. This 
		system is used for most network related operations between 
		Windows NT machines including remote management, user authentication
		and print spooling. Although initially this work was done 
		to aid the implementation of Primary Domain Controller (PDC) 
		functionality in Samba, it has also yielded a body of code which 
		can be used for other purposes.</P
><P
>Winbind uses various MSRPC calls to enumerate domain users 
		and groups and to obtain detailed information about individual 
		users or groups. Other MSRPC calls can be used to authenticate 
		NT domain users and to change user passwords. By directly querying 
		a Windows PDC for user and group information, winbind maps the 
		NT account information onto UNIX user and group names.</P

>11.4.2. Name Service Switch</A
></H2
><P
>The Name Service Switch, or NSS, is a feature that is 
		present in many UNIX operating systems. It allows system 
		information such as hostnames, mail aliases and user information 
		to be resolved from different sources. For example, a standalone 
		UNIX workstation may resolve system information from a series of 
		flat files stored on the local filesystem. A networked workstation 
		may first attempt to resolve system information from local files, 
		and then consult a NIS database for user information or a DNS server 
		for hostname information.</P
><P
>The NSS application programming interface allows winbind 
		to present itself as a source of system information when 
		resolving UNIX usernames and groups.  Winbind uses this interface, 
		and information obtained from a Windows NT server using MSRPC 
		calls to provide a new source of account enumeration.  Using standard 
		UNIX library calls, one can enumerate the users and groups on
		a UNIX machine running winbind and see all users and groups in 
		a NT domain plus any trusted domain as though they were local 
		users and groups.</P
><P
>The primary control file for NSS is 
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT
>. 
		When a UNIX application makes a request to do a lookup 
		the C library looks in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT
> 
		for a line which matches the service type being requested, for 
		example the "passwd" service type is used when user or group names 
		are looked up. This	config line species which implementations 
		of that service should be tried and in what order. If the passwd 
		config line is:</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd: files example</B
></P
><P
>then the C library will first load a module called 
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/libnss_files.so</TT
> followed by
		the module <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/libnss_example.so</TT
>. The 
		C library will dynamically load each of these modules in turn 
		and call resolver functions within the modules to try to resolve 
		the request. Once the request is resolved the C library returns the
		result to the application.</P
><P
>This NSS interface provides a very easy way for Winbind 
		to hook into the operating system. All that needs to be done 
		is to put <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libnss_winbind.so</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/</TT
> 
		then add "winbind" into <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT

		the appropriate place. The C library will then call Winbind to 
		resolve user and group names.</P

>Pluggable Authentication Modules, also known as PAM, 
		is a system for abstracting authentication and authorization 
		technologies. With a PAM module it is possible to specify different 
		authentication methods for different system applications without 
		having to recompile these applications. PAM is also useful
		for implementing a particular policy for authorization. For example, 
		a system administrator may only allow console logins from users 
		stored in the local password file but only allow users resolved from 
		a NIS database to log in over the network.</P
><P
>Winbind uses the authentication management and password 
		management PAM interface to integrate Windows NT users into a 
		UNIX system. This allows Windows NT users to log in to a UNIX 
		machine and be authenticated against a suitable Primary Domain 
		Controller. These users can also change their passwords and have 
		this change take effect directly on the Primary Domain Controller.
		</P
><P
>PAM is configured by providing control files in the directory 
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/pam.d/</TT
> for each of the services that 
		require authentication. When an authentication request is made 
		by an application the PAM code in the C library looks up this
		control file to determine what modules to load to do the 
		authentication check and in what order. This interface makes adding 
		a new authentication service for Winbind very easy, all that needs 
		to be done is that the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pam_winbind.so</TT
> module 
		is copied to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/security/</TT

		store Windows NT users and groups. If a Windows NT user is 
		resolved for the first time, it is allocated the next UNIX id from 
		the range. The same process applies for Windows NT groups. Over 
		time, winbind will have mapped all Windows NT users and groups

		returned by the PDC. This sequence number is incremented by 
		Windows NT whenever any user or group information is modified. If 
		a cached entry has expired, the sequence number is requested from

means <TT

>Adding the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver is not described

		MPTS.EXE, click on OK, click on "Configure LAPS" and click 
		on "IBM OS/2 NETBIOS OVER TCP/IP" in  'Protocols'.  This line

		click on "Change number" and increase it from 0 to 1. Save this

>If the Samba server(s) is not on your local subnet, you 
		can optionally add IP names and addresses of these servers 
		to the "Names List", or specify a  WINS server ('NetBIOS 
		Nameserver' in IBM and RFC terminology). For Warp Connect you 
		may need to download an update for 'IBM Peer' to bring it on
