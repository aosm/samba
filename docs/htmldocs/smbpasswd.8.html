><P
>This tool is part of the <A
HREF="samba.7.html"
TARGET="_top"
>	Samba</A
> suite.</P
><P
>The smbpasswd program has several different 
	functions, depending on whether it is run by the <EM
>root</EM
> 
	user or not. When run as a normal user it allows the user to change 
	the password used for their SMB sessions on any machines that store 
	SMB passwords. </P
><P
>By default (when run with no arguments) it will attempt to 
	change the current user's SMB password on the local machine. This is 
	similar to the way the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>passwd(1)</B
> program works. 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbpasswd</B
> differs from how the passwd program works 
	however in that it is not <EM
>setuid root</EM
> but works in 
	a client-server mode and communicates with a locally running
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbd(8)</B
>. As a consequence in order for this to 
	succeed the smbd daemon must be running on the local machine. On a 
	UNIX machine the encrypted SMB passwords are usually stored in 
	the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>smbpasswd(5)</TT
> file. </P
><P
>When run by an ordinary user with no options. smbpasswd 
	will prompt them for their old SMB password and then ask them 
	for their new password twice, to ensure that the new password
	was typed correctly. No passwords will be echoed on the screen 
	whilst being typed. If you have a blank SMB password (specified by 
	the string "NO PASSWORD" in the smbpasswd file) then just press 
	the &#60;Enter&#62; key when asked for your old password. </P
><P
>smbpasswd can also be used by a normal user to change their
	SMB password on remote machines, such as Windows NT Primary Domain 
	Controllers.   See the (-r) and -U options below. </P
><P
>When run by root, smbpasswd allows new users to be added 
	and deleted in the smbpasswd file, as well as allows changes to 
	the attributes of the user in this file to be made. When run by root, 
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbpasswd</B
> accesses the local smbpasswd file 
	directly, thus enabling changes to be made even if smbd is not 
	running. </P
