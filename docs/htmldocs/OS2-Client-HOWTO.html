>Basically, you need three components:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The File and Print Client ('IBM Peer')
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>TCP/IP ('Internet support') 
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver ('TCPBEUI')
			</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Installing the first two together with the base operating 
		system on a blank system is explained in the Warp manual. If Warp 
		has already been installed, but you now want to install the 
		networking support, use the "Selective Install for Networking" 
		object in the "System Setup" folder.</P
><P
>Adding the "NetBIOS over TCP/IP" driver is not described 
		in the manual and just barely in the online documentation. Start 
		MPTS.EXE, click on OK, click on "Configure LAPS" and click 
		on "IBM OS/2 NETBIOS OVER TCP/IP" in  'Protocols'.  This line 
		is then moved to 'Current Configuration'. Select that line, 
		click on "Change number" and increase it from 0 to 1. Save this
		configuration.</P
><P
>If the Samba server(s) is not on your local subnet, you 
		can optionally add IP names and addresses of these servers 
		to the "Names List", or specify a  WINS server ('NetBIOS 
		Nameserver' in IBM and RFC terminology). For Warp Connect you 
		may need to download an update for 'IBM Peer' to bring it on 
		the same level as Warp 4. See the webpage mentioned above.</P

>When you do a NET VIEW or use the "File and Print 
		Client Resource Browser", no Samba servers show up. This can 
		be fixed by a patch from <A
HREF="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/fix.html"
TARGET="_top"
>		http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leeuw/samba/fix.html</A
>.
		The patch will be included in a later version of Samba. It also 
		fixes a couple of other problems, such as preserving long 
		filenames when objects are dragged from the Workplace Shell 
		to the Samba server. </P

>How do I get printer driver download working 
		for OS/2 clients?</A
></H2
><P
>First, create a share called [PRINTDRV] that is 
		world-readable.  Copy your OS/2 driver files there.  Note 
		that the .EA_ files must still be separate, so you will need 
		to use the original install files, and not copy an installed 
		driver from an OS/2 system.</P
><P
>Install the NT driver first for that printer.  Then, 
		add to your smb.conf a parameter, "os2 driver map = 
		<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>".  Then, in the file 
		specified by <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>filename</I
></TT
>, map the 
		name of the NT driver name to the OS/2 driver name as 
		follows:</P
><P
>&lt;nt driver name&gt; = &lt;os2 driver 
		name&gt;.&lt;device name&gt;, e.g.:
		HP LaserJet 5L = LASERJET.HP LaserJet 5L</P
><P
>You can have multiple drivers mapped in this file.</P
><P
>If you only specify the OS/2 driver name, and not the 
		device name, the first attempt to download the driver will 
		actually download the files, but the OS/2 client will tell 
		you the driver is not available.  On the second attempt, it 
		will work.  This is fixed simply by adding the device name
  		 to the mapping, after which it will work on the first attempt.
