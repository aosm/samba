>DESCRIPTION</H2
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmount</B
> mounts a Linux SMB filesystem. It 
	is usually invoked as <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount.smbfs</B
> by
	the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>mount(8)</B
> command when using the 
	"-t smbfs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
	support the smbfs filesystem. </P
><P
>Options to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmount</B
> are specified as a comma-separated
	list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
	than those listed here, assuming that smbfs supports them. If
	you get mount failures, check your kernel log for errors on
	unknown options.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmount</B
> is a daemon. After mounting it keeps running until
	the mounted smbfs is umounted. It will log things that happen
	when in daemon mode using the "machine name" smbmount, so
	typically this output will end up in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>log.smbmount</TT
>. The
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmount</B
> process may also be called mount.smbfs.</P
><P
><EM
>NOTE:</EM
> <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmount</B
> 
	calls <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmnt(8)</B
> to do the actual mount. You 
	must make sure that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>smbmnt</B
> is in the path so 
	that it can be found. </P

>BUGS</H2
><P
>Passwords and other options containing , can not be handled.
	For passwords an alternative way of passing them is in a credentials
	file or in the PASSWD environment.</P
><P
>The credentials file does not handle usernames or passwords with
	leading space.</P
><P
>One smbfs bug is important enough to mention here, even if it
	is a bit misplaced:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Mounts sometimes stop working. This is usually
	caused by smbmount terminating. Since smbfs needs smbmount to
	reconnect when the server disconnects, the mount will eventually go
	dead. An umount/mount normally fixes this. At least 2 ways to
	trigger this bug are known.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Note that the typical response to a bug report is suggestion
	to try the latest version first. So please try doing that first,
	and always include which versions you use of relevant software
	when reporting bugs (minimum: samba, kernel, distribution)</P
