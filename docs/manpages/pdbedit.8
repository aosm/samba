.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
The pdbedit program is used to manage the users accounts
stored in the sam database and can be run only by root.
.PP
The pdbedit tool use the passdb modular interface and is
independent from the kind of users database used (currently there
are smbpasswd, ldap, nis+ and tdb based and more can be addedd
without changing the tool).

There are five main ways to use pdbedit: adding a user account,
removing a user account, modifing a user account, listing user
accounts, importing users accounts.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
