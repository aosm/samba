.TH SMBRUN 1 "24 Mar 2001" "smbrun 2.2.0-alpha3"
.SH NAME
smbrun \- interface program between smbd and external  programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbrun\fR \fB<shell command>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBsmbrun\fR is a very small 'glue' program, 
which runs shell commands for the \fB smbd(8)\fRdaemon.
.PP
It first changes to the highest effective user and group 
ID that it can, then runs the command line provided using the 
system() call. This program is necessary to allow some operating 
systems to run external programs as non-root.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBshell command\fR
The shell command to execute. The 
command should have a fully-qualified path.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The \fIPATH\fR variable set for the 
environment in which \fBsmbrun\fR is executed will affect 
what executables are located and executed if a fully-qualified path
is not given in the command.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
If \fBsmbrun\fR cannot be located or cannot 
be executed by \fBsmbd(8)\fR
, then appropriate messages will be found in the \fB smbd\fR logs. Other diagnostics are dependent on the shell-command 
being run. It is advisable for your shell commands to issue suitable 
diagnostics to aid trouble-shooting.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBnmbd(8)\fR, 
\fBsmbclient(1)
\fR.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
