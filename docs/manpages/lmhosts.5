.SH NAME
lmhosts \- The Samba NetBIOS hosts file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fIlmhosts\fR is the  SambaNetBIOS name to IP address mapping file.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This file is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fIlmhosts\fR is the \fBSamba
\fRNetBIOS name to IP address mapping file. It 
is very similar to the \fI/etc/hosts\fR file 
format, except that the hostname component must correspond 
to the NetBIOS naming format.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
It is an ASCII file containing one line for NetBIOS name. 
The two fields on each line are separated from each other by 
white space. Any entry beginning with '#' is ignored. Each line 
in the lmhosts file contains the following information :
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
IP Address - in dotted decimal format.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
NetBIOS Name - This name format is a 
maximum fifteen character host name, with an optional 
trailing '#' character followed by the NetBIOS name type 
as two hexadecimal digits.

If the trailing '#' is omitted then the given IP 
address will be returned for all names that match the given 
name, whatever the NetBIOS name type in the lookup.
.PP
An example follows :
.PP
.PP
.sp
.nf
#
# Sample Samba lmhosts file.
#
192.9.200.1	TESTPC
192.9.200.20	NTSERVER#20
192.9.200.21	SAMBASERVER
	
.sp
.fi
.PP
.PP
Contains three IP to NetBIOS name mappings. The first 
and third will be returned for any queries for the names "TESTPC" 
and "SAMBASERVER" respectively, whatever the type component of 
the NetBIOS name requested.
.PP
.PP
The second mapping will be returned only when the "0x20" name 
type for a name "NTSERVER" is queried. Any other name type will not 
be resolved.
.PP
.PP
The default location of the \fIlmhosts\fR file 
is in the same directory as the  
smb.conf(5)>file.
.PP
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

\fR
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
