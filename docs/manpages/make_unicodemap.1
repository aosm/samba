.SH NAME
make_unicodemap \- construct a unicode map file for Samba
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBmake_unicodemap\fR \fBcodepage\fR \fBinputfile\fR \fBoutputfile\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the Samba
suite.
.PP
\fBmake_unicodemap\fR compiles text unicode map 
files into binary unicode map files for use with the 
internationalization features of Samba 2.2.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBcodepage\fR
This is the codepage or UNIX character 
set we are processing (a number, e.g. 850).
.TP
\fBinputfile\fR
This is the input file to process. This is a 
text unicode map file such as the ones found in the Samba
\fIsource/codepages\fR directory. 
.TP
\fBoutputfile\fR
This is the binary output file to produce. 
.SH "SAMBA UNICODE MAP FILES"
.PP
A text Samba unicode map file is a description that tells Samba 
how to map characters from a specified DOS code page or UNIX character 
set to 16 bit unicode.
.PP
A binary Samba unicode map file is a binary representation 
of the same information, including a value that specifies what 
codepage or UNIX character set this file is describing. 
.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fICP<codepage>.TXT\fR
.PP
These are the input (text) unicode map files provided 
in the Samba \fIsource/codepages\fR 
directory. 
.PP
A text unicode map file consists of multiple lines 
containing two fields. These fields are : 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIcharacter\fR - which is 
the (hex) character mapped on this line.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIunicode\fR - which 
is the (hex) 16 bit unicode character that the character
will map to. 
.PP
\fIunicode_map.<codepage>\fR - These are 
the output (binary) unicode map files produced and placed in 
the Samba destination \fIlib/codepage\fR 
directory.
.PP
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
The location of the server and its support files is a matter
for individual system administrators. The following are thus 
suggestions only. 
.PP
It is recommended that the \fBmake_unicodemap\fR 
program be installed under the 
\fI$prefix/samba\fR hierarchy, 
in a directory readable by all, writeable only by root. The 
program itself should be executable by all. The program
should NOT be setuid or setgid! 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBsmbd(8)\fR, 
smb.conf(5)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
