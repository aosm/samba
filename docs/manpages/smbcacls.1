.SH NAME
smbcacls \- Set or get ACLs on an NT file or directory names
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsmbcacls\fR \fB//server/share\fR \fBfilename\fR [ \fB-U username\fR ]  [ \fB-A acls\fR ]  [ \fB-M acls\fR ]  [ \fB-D acls\fR ]  [ \fB-S acls\fR ]  [ \fB-C name\fR ]  [ \fB-G name\fR ]  [ \fB-n\fR ]  [ \fB-h\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
The \fBsmbcacls\fR program manipulates NT Access Control Lists 
(ACLs) on SMB file shares. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are available to the \fBsmbcacls\fR program. 
The format of ACLs is described in the section ACL FORMAT 
.TP
\fB-A acls\fR
Add the ACLs specified to the ACL list. Existing 
access control entries are unchanged. 
.TP
\fB-M acls\fR
Modify the mask value (permissions) for the ACLs 
specified on the command line. An error will be printed for each 
ACL specified that was not already present in the ACL list
.TP
\fB-D acls\fR
Delete any ACLs specified on the command line. 
An error will be printed for each ACL specified that was not 
already present in the ACL list. 
.TP
\fB-S acls\fR
This command sets the ACLs on the file with 
only the ones specified on the command line. All other ACLs are 
erased. Note that the ACL specified must contain at least a revision, 
type, owner and group for the call to succeed. 
.TP
\fB-U username\fR
Specifies a username used to connect to the 
specified service. The username may be of the form "username" in 
which case the user is prompted to enter in a password and the 
workgroup specified in the \fIsmb.conf\fR file is 
used, or "username%password" or "DOMAIN\\username%password" and the 
password and workgroup names are used as provided. 
.TP
\fB-C name\fR
The owner of a file or directory can be changed 
to the name given using the \fI-C\fR option. 
The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved 
against the server specified in the first argument. 

This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name. 
.TP
\fB-G name\fR
The group owner of a file or directory can 
be changed to the name given using the \fI-G\fR 
option. The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name 
resolved against the server specified n the first argument.

This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.
.TP
\fB-n\fR
This option displays all ACL information in numeric 
format. The default is to convert SIDs to names and ACE types 
and masks to a readable string format. 
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print usage information on the \fBsmbcacls
\fRprogram.
.SH "ACL FORMAT"
.PP
The format of an ACL is one or more ACL entries separated by 
either commas or newlines. An ACL entry is one of the following: 
.PP
.sp
.nf
 
REVISION:<revision number>
OWNER:<sid or name>
GROUP:<sid or name>
ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>
	
.sp
.fi
.PP
The revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows 
NT ACL revision for the security descriptor. 
If not specified it defaults to 1. Using values other than 1 may 
cause strange behaviour. 
.PP
The owner and group specify the owner and group sids for the 
object. If a SID in the format CWS-1-x-y-z is specified this is used, 
otherwise the name specified is resolved using the server on which 
the file or directory resides. 
.PP
ACLs specify permissions granted to the SID. This SID again 
can be specified in CWS-1-x-y-z format or as a name in which case 
it is resolved against the server on which the file or directory 
resides. The type, flags and mask values determine the type of 
access granted to the SID. 
.PP
The type can be either 0 or 1 corresponding to ALLOWED or 
DENIED access to the SID. The flags values are generally
zero for file ACLs and either 9 or 2 for directory ACLs. Some 
common flags are: 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT 0x1
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT 0x2
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT 0x4
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
#define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY 0x8
.PP
At present flags can only be specified as decimal or 
hexadecimal values.
.PP
.PP
The mask is a value which expresses the access right 
granted to the SID. It can be given as a decimal or hexadecimal value, 
or by using one of the following text strings which map to the NT 
file permissions of the same name. 
.PP
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBR\fR - Allow read access 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBW\fR - Allow write access
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBX\fR - Execute permission on the object
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBD\fR - Delete the object
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBP\fR - Change permissions
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBO\fR - Take ownership
.PP
The following combined permissions can be specified:
.PP
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBREAD\fR - Equivalent to 'RX'
permissions
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBCHANGE\fR - Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBFULL\fR - Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' 
permissions
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
The \fBsmbcacls\fR program sets the exit status 
depending on the success or otherwise of the operations performed. 
The exit status may be one of the following values. 
.PP
If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit 
status of 0. If \fBsmbcacls\fR couldn't connect to the specified server, 
or there was an error getting or setting the ACLs, an exit status 
of 1 is returned. If there was an error parsing any command line 
arguments, an exit status of 2 is returned. 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
\fBsmbcacls\fR was written by Andrew Tridgell 
and Tim Potter.
.PP
The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done 
by Gerald Carter
