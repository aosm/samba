.SH NAME
swat \- Samba Web Administration Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBswat\fR [ \fB-s <smb config file>\fR ]  [ \fB-a\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the  Sambasuite.
.PP
\fBswat\fR allows a Samba administrator to 
configure the complex \fI smb.conf(5)\fRfile via a Web browser. In addition, 
a \fBswat\fR configuration page has help links 
to all the configurable options in the \fIsmb.conf\fR file allowing an 
administrator to easily look up the effects of any change. 
.PP
\fBswat\fR is run from \fBinetd\fR 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-s smb configuration file\fR
The default configuration file path is 
determined at compile time. The file specified contains 
the configuration details required by the \fBsmbd
\fRserver. This is the file that \fBswat\fR will modify. 
The information in this file includes server-specific 
information such as what printcap file to use, as well as 
descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide.
See \fIsmb.conf\fR for more information. 
.TP
\fB-a\fR
This option disables authentication and puts 
\fBswat\fR in demo mode. In that mode anyone will be able to modify 
the \fIsmb.conf\fR file. 

\fBDo NOT enable this option on a production 
server. \fR
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.PP
After you compile SWAT you need to run \fBmake install
\fRto install the \fBswat\fR binary
and the various help files and images. A default install would put 
these in: 
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/bin/swat
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/swat/images/*
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
/usr/local/samba/swat/help/*
.SS "INETD INSTALLATION"
.PP
You need to edit your \fI/etc/inetd.conf
\fRand \fI/etc/services\fR
to enable SWAT to be launched via \fBinetd\fR.
.PP
In \fI/etc/services\fR you need to 
add a line like this: 
.PP
\fBswat 901/tcp\fR
.PP
Note for NIS/YP users - you may need to rebuild the 
NIS service maps rather than alter your local \fI /etc/services\fR file. 
.PP
the choice of port number isn't really important 
except that it should be less than 1024 and not currently 
used (using a number above 1024 presents an obscure security 
hole depending on the implementation details of your 
\fBinetd\fR daemon). 
.PP
In \fI/etc/inetd.conf\fR you should 
add a line like this: 
.PP
\fBswat stream tcp nowait.400 root
/usr/local/samba/bin/swat swat\fR
.PP
One you have edited \fI/etc/services\fR 
and \fI/etc/inetd.conf\fR you need to send a 
HUP signal to inetd. To do this use \fBkill -1 PID
\fRwhere PID is the process ID of the inetd daemon. 
.SS "LAUNCHING"
.PP
To launch SWAT just run your favorite web browser and 
point it at "http://localhost:901/".
.PP
Note that you can attach to SWAT from any IP connected 
machine but connecting from a remote machine leaves your 
connection open to password sniffing as passwords will be sent 
in the clear over the wire. 
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/inetd.conf\fB\fR
This file must contain suitable startup 
information for the meta-daemon.
.TP
\fB\fI/etc/services\fB\fR
This file must contain a mapping of service name 
(e.g., swat) to service port (e.g., 901) and protocol type 
(e.g., tcp). 
.TP
\fB\fI/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf\fB\fR
This is the default location of the \fIsmb.conf(5)
\fRserver configuration file that swat edits. Other 
common places that systems install this file are \fI /usr/samba/lib/smb.conf\fR and \fI/etc/smb.conf
\fR\&. This file describes all the services the server 
is to make available to clients. 
.SH "WARNINGS"
.PP
\fBswat\fR will rewrite your \fIsmb.conf
\fRfile. It will rearrange the entries and delete all 
comments, \fIinclude=\fR and \fIcopy="
\fRoptions. If you have a carefully crafted \fI smb.conf\fR then back it up or don't use swat! 
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of 
the Samba suite.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBinetd(5)\fR,
\fBsmbd(8)\fR, 
smb.conf(5)
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
