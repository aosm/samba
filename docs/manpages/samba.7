.SH NAME
SAMBA \- A Windows SMB/CIFS fileserver for UNIX
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBSamba\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Samba software suite is a collection of programs 
that implements the Server Message Block (commonly abbreviated 
as SMB) protocol for UNIX systems. This protocol is sometimes 
also referred to as the Common Internet File System (CIFS), 
LanManager or NetBIOS protocol.
.TP
\fBsmbd\fR
The \fBsmbd \fR
daemon provides the file and print services to 
SMB clients, such as Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 
for Workgroups or LanManager. The configuration file 
for this daemon is described in \fIsmb.conf\fR
.TP
\fBnmbd\fR
The \fBnmbd\fR
daemon provides NetBIOS nameserving and browsing
support. The configuration file for this daemon 
is described in \fIsmb.conf\fR
.TP
\fBsmbclient\fR
The \fBsmbclient\fR
program implements a simple ftp-like client. This 
is useful for accessing SMB shares on other compatible
servers (such as Windows NT), and can also be used 
to allow a UNIX box to print to a printer attached to 
any SMB server (such as a PC running Windows NT).
.TP
\fBtestparm\fR
The \fBtestparm\fR
utility is a simple syntax checker for Samba's
\fIsmb.conf\fRconfiguration file.
.TP
\fBtestprns\fR
The \fBtestprns\fR
utility supports testing printer names defined 
in your \fIprintcap>\fR file used 
by Samba.
.TP
\fBsmbstatus\fR
The \fBsmbstatus\fR
tool provides access to information about the 
current connections to \fBsmbd\fR.
.TP
\fBnmblookup\fR
The \fBnmblookup\fR
tools allows NetBIOS name queries to be made 
from a UNIX host.
.TP
\fBmake_smbcodepage\fR
The \fBmake_smbcodepage\fR
utility provides a means of creating SMB code page 
definition files for your \fBsmbd\fR server.
.TP
\fBsmbpasswd\fR
The \fBsmbpasswd\fR
command is a tool for changing LanMan and Windows NT 
password hashes on Samba and Windows NT servers.
.SH "COMPONENTS"
.PP
The Samba suite is made up of several components. Each 
component is described in a separate manual page. It is strongly 
recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba 
and the manual pages of those components that you use. If the 
manual pages aren't clear enough then please send a patch or 
bug report to  samba@samba.org <URL:mailto:samba@samba.org>
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
The Samba software suite is licensed under the 
GNU Public License(GPL). A copy of that license should 
have come with the package in the file COPYING. You are 
encouraged to distribute copies of the Samba suite, but 
please obey the terms of this license.
.PP
The latest version of the Samba suite can be 
obtained via anonymous ftp from samba.org in the
directory pub/samba/. It is also available on several 
mirror sites worldwide.
.PP
You may also find useful information about Samba 
on the newsgroup  comp.protocol.smb <URL:news:comp.protocols.smb> and the Samba mailing 
list. Details on how to join the mailing list are given in 
the README file that comes with Samba.
.PP
If you have access to a WWW viewer (such as Netscape 
or Mosaic) then you will also find lots of useful information, 
including back issues of the Samba mailing list, at
http://lists.samba.org <URL:http://lists.samba.org/>.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is correct for version 2.2 of the 
Samba suite. 
.SH "CONTRIBUTIONS"
.PP
If you wish to contribute to the Samba project, 
then I suggest you join the Samba mailing list at 
http://lists.samba.org <URL:http://lists.samba.org/>.
.PP
If you have patches to submit or bugs to report 
then you may mail them directly to samba-patches@samba.org.
Note, however, that due to the enormous popularity of this 
package the Samba Team may take some time to respond to mail. We 
prefer patches in \fBdiff -u\fR format.
.SH "CONTRIBUTORS"
.PP
Contributors to the project are now too numerous 
to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba 
users. To see a full list, look at  ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log <URL:ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/change-log>
for the pre-CVS changes and at  ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log <URL:ftp://samba.org/pub/samba/alpha/cvs.log>
for the contributors to Samba post-CVS. CVS is the Open Source 
source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop 
Samba. The project would have been unmanageable without it.
.PP
In addition, several commercial organizations now help 
fund the Samba Team with money and equipment. For details see 
the Samba Web pages at  http://samba.org/samba/samba-thanks.html.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities 
were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar 
to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
.PP
The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. 
The man page sources were converted to YODL format (another 
excellent piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/ <URL:ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/>) and updated for the Samba 2.0 
release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for 
Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter
