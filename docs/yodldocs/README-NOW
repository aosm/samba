!== Notice of change of documentation format
!==

Samba is no longer using yodl as the source markup
language for our documentation.  As of release 2.2.0,
we are using DocBook V4.1 exclusively (assuming you are not
counting the ASCII files yet to be converted).

Please see ../docbook/docbook.txt for more information
on this.
