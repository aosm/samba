Versions of Samba prior to release 2.2 had marginal capabilities to act
as a Windows NT 4.0 Primary Domain Controller
<indexterm><primary>Primary Domain Controller</primary></indexterm>
(PDC).  With Samba 2.2.0, we are proud to announce official support for
Windows NT 4.0-style domain logons from Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 
2000 clients.  This article outlines the steps
necessary for configuring Samba as a PDC.  It is necessary to have a
working Samba server prior to implementing the PDC functionality.  If
you have not followed the steps outlined in <ulink
url="UNIX_INSTALL.html"> UNIX_INSTALL.html</ulink>, please make sure
that your server is configured correctly before proceeding.  Another
good resource in the <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf(5) man
page</ulink>. The following functionality should work in 2.2:

Please note that Windows 9x clients are not true members of a domain
for reasons outlined in this article.  Therefore the protocol for
support Windows 9x-style domain logons is completely different
from NT4 domain logons and has been officially supported for some 
time.

<para>
Implementing a Samba PDC can basically be divided into 2 broad

<sect1>
<title>Configuring the Samba Domain Controller</title>

<para>
The first step in creating a working Samba PDC is to 
understand the parameters necessary in smb.conf.  I will not
attempt to re-explain the parameters here as they are more that
adequately covered in <ulink url="smb.conf.5.html"> the smb.conf
man page</ulink>.  For convenience, the parameters have been
linked with the actual smb.conf description.
</para>

<para>
Here is an example <filename>smb.conf</filename> for acting as a PDC:

<para>
There are a couple of points to emphasize in the above configuration.

</itemizedlist>    

<para>
As Samba 2.2 does not offer a complete implementation of group mapping
between Windows NT groups and Unix groups (this is really quite
complicated to explain in a short space), you should refer to the
<ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#DOMAINADMINGROUP">domain admin
group</ulink> smb.conf parameter for information of creating "Domain
Admins" style accounts.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Creating Machine Trust Accounts and Joining Clients to the
Domain</title>

<para>
A machine trust account is a Samba account that is used to
authenticate a client machine (rather than a user) to the Samba
server.  In Windows terminology, this is known as a "Computer
Account."</para>

<para>
The password of a machine trust account acts as the shared secret for
secure communication with the Domain Controller.  This is a security
feature to prevent an unauthorized machine with the same NetBIOS name
from joining the domain and gaining access to domain user/group
accounts.  Windows NT and 2000 clients use machine trust accounts, but
Windows 9x clients do not.  Hence, a Windows 9x client is never a true
member of a domain because it does not possess a machine trust
account, and thus has no shared secret with the domain controller.
</para>

<para>A Windows PDC stores each machine trust account in the Windows
Registry.  A Samba PDC, however, stores each machine trust account 
in two parts, as follows:

<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>A Samba account, stored in the same location as user
    LanMan and NT password hashes (currently
    <filename>smbpasswd</filename>). The Samba account 
    possesses and uses only the NT password hash.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>A corresponding Unix account, typically stored in
    <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>. (Future releases will alleviate the need to
    create <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entries.) </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
There are two ways to create machine trust accounts:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para> Manual creation. Both the Samba and corresponding
	Unix account are created by hand.</para></listitem>
	
	<listitem><para> "On-the-fly" creation. The Samba machine trust
	account is automatically created by Samba at the time the client
	is joined to the domain. (For security, this is the
	recommended method.) The corresponding Unix account may be
	created automatically or manually. </para>
	</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<sect2>
<title>Manual Creation of Machine Trust Accounts</title>

<para>
The first step in manually creating a machine trust account is to
manually create the corresponding Unix account in
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename>.  This can be done using
<command>vipw</command> or other 'add user' command that is normally
used to create new Unix accounts.  The following is an example for a
Linux based Samba server:
</para>

<para>
  <prompt>root# </prompt><command>/usr/sbin/useradd -g 100 -d /dev/null -c <replaceable>"machine 
nickname"</replaceable> -s /bin/false <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable>$ </command>
</para>
<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt><command>passwd -l <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable>$</command>
</para>

<para>
The <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry will list the machine name 
with a "$" appended, won't have a password, will have a null shell and no 
home directory. For example a machine named 'doppy' would have an 
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry like this:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
doppy$:x:505:501:<replaceable>machine_nickname</replaceable>:/dev/null:/bin/false
</programlisting></para>

<para>
Above, <replaceable>machine_nickname</replaceable> can be any
descriptive name for the client, i.e., BasementComputer.
<replaceable>machine_name</replaceable> absolutely must be the NetBIOS
name of the client to be joined to the domain.  The "$" must be
appended to the NetBIOS name of the client or Samba will not recognize
this as a machine trust account.
</para>


<para>
Now that the corresponding Unix account has been created, the next step is to create 
the Samba account for the client containing the well-known initial 
machine trust account password.  This can be done using the <ulink 
url="smbpasswd.8.html"><command>smbpasswd(8)</command></ulink> command 
as shown here:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>root# </prompt><command>smbpasswd -a -m <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable></command>
</para>

<para>
where <replaceable>machine_name</replaceable> is the machine's NetBIOS
name.  The RID of the new machine account is generated from the UID of 
the corresponding Unix account.
</para>

<warning>
	<title>Join the client to the domain immediately</title>

	<para>
	Manually creating a machine trust account using this method is the 
	equivalent of creating a machine trust account on a Windows NT PDC using 
	the "Server Manager".  From the time at which the account is created
	to the time which the client joins the domain and changes the password,
	your domain is vulnerable to an intruder joining your domain using a
	a machine with the same NetBIOS name.  A PDC inherently trusts
	members of the domain and will serve out a large degree of user 
	information to such clients.  You have been warned!
	</para>
</warning>
</sect2>


<sect2>
<title>"On-the-Fly" Creation of Machine Trust Accounts</title>

<para>
The second (and recommended) way of creating machine trust accounts is
simply to allow the Samba server to create them as needed when the client
is joined to the domain. </para>

<para>Since each Samba machine trust account requires a corresponding
Unix account, a method for automatically creating the
Unix account is usually supplied; this requires configuration of the
<ulink url="smb.conf.5.html#ADDUSERSCRIPT">add user script</ulink> 
option in <filename>smb.conf</filename>.  This
method is not required, however; corresponding Unix accounts may also
be created manually.
</para>


<para>Below is an example for a RedHat 6.2 Linux system.
</para>

<para><programlisting>
[global]
   # <...remainder of parameters...>
   add user script = /usr/sbin/useradd -d /dev/null -g 100 -s /bin/false -M %u 
</programlisting></para>

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Joining the Client to the Domain</title>

<para>
The procedure for joining a client to the domain varies with the
version of Windows.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Windows 2000</emphasis></para>

	<para> When the user elects to join the client to a domain, Windows prompts for
	an account and password that is privileged to join the domain.  A
	Samba administrative account (i.e., a Samba account that has root
	privileges on the Samba server) must be entered here; the
	operation will fail if an ordinary user account is given. 
	The password for this account should be
	set to a different password than the associated
	<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> entry, for security
	reasons. </para>

	<para>The session key of the Samba administrative account acts as an
	encryption key for setting the password of the machine trust
	account. The machine trust account will be created on-the-fly, or
	updated if it already exists.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis>Windows NT</emphasis></para>

    <para> If the machine trust account was created manually, on the
	Identification Changes menu enter the domain name, but do not
	check the box "Create a Computer Account in the Domain."  In this case,
	the existing machine trust account is used to join the machine to
	the domain.</para>

    <para> If the machine trust account is to be created
	on-the-fly, on the Identification Changes menu enter the domain
	name, and check the box "Create a Computer Account in the Domain."  In
	this case, joining the domain proceeds as above for Windows 2000
	(i.e., you must supply a Samba administrative account when
	prompted).</para>

</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>I cannot include a '$' in a machine name.</emphasis>
	</para>
    
	<para>
	A 'machine name' in (typically) <filename>/etc/passwd</> 	
	of the machine name with a '$' appended. FreeBSD (and other BSD 
	systems?) won't create a user with a '$' in their name.
	</para>

	<para>
	The problem is only in the program used to make the entry, once 
	made, it works perfectly. So create a user without the '$' and 
	use <command>vipw</> to edit the entry, adding the '$'. Or create 
	the whole entry with vipw if you like, make sure you use a 
	unique User ID !
	</para>
</listitem>
  
<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>I get told "You already have a connection to the Domain...." 
	or "Cannot join domain, the credentials supplied conflict with an 
	existing set.." when creating a machine trust account.</emphasis>
	</para>

	<para>
	This happens if you try to create a machine trust account from the 
	machine itself and already have a connection (e.g. mapped drive) 
	to a share (or IPC$) on the Samba PDC.  The following command
	will remove all network drive connections:
	</para>

	<para>
	<prompt>C:\WINNT\></prompt> <command>net use * /d</command>
	</para>

	<para>
	Further, if the machine is a already a 'member of a workgroup' that 
	is the same name as the domain you are joining (bad idea) you will 
	get this message.  Change the workgroup name to something else, it 
	does not matter what, reboot, and try again.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	<emphasis>The system can not log you on (C000019B)....</emphasis>
	</para>

	<para>I joined the domain successfully but after upgrading 
	to a newer version of the Samba code I get the message, "The system 
	can not log you on (C000019B), Please try a gain or consult your 
	system administrator" when attempting to logon.
	</para>

	<para>
	This occurs when the domain SID stored in 
	<filename>private/WORKGROUP.SID</filename> is 
	changed.  For example, you remove the file and <command>smbd</command> automatically 
	creates a new one.  Or you are swapping back and forth between 
	versions 2.0.7, TNG and the HEAD branch code (not recommended).  The 
	only way to correct the problem is to restore the original domain 
	SID or remove the domain client from the domain and rejoin.

	When I try to join the domain I get the message "The machine account 
	for this computer either does not exist or is not accessible". What's 
	wrong?
	</para>

	<para>
	This problem is caused by the PDC not having a suitable machine trust account. 
	If you are using the <parameter>add user script</parameter> method to create 
	accounts then this would indicate that it has not worked. Ensure the domain 
	admin user system is working.
	</para>

	<para>
	Alternatively if you are creating account entries manually then they 
	have not been created correctly. Make sure that you have the entry 
	correct for the machine trust account in smbpasswd file on the Samba PDC. 
	If you added the account using an editor rather than using the smbpasswd 
	utility, make sure that the account name is the machine NetBIOS name 
	with a '$' appended to it ( i.e. computer_name$ ). There must be an entry 
	in both /etc/passwd and the smbpasswd file. Some people have reported 
	that inconsistent subnet masks between the Samba server and the NT 
	client have caused this problem.   Make sure that these are consistent 
	for both client and server.

	<emphasis>When I attempt to login to a Samba Domain from a NT4/W2K workstation,

	</para>

	<para>
	This problem is caused by a PAM related bug in Samba 2.2.0.  This bug is 
	fixed in 2.2.1.  Other symptoms could be unaccessible shares on

<para>
There are many sources of information available in the form 
of mailing lists, RFC's and documentation.  The docs that come 
with the samba distribution contain very good explanations of 
general SMB topics such as browsing.</para>

	<emphasis>What are some diagnostics tools I can use to debug the domain logon 
	process and where can I	find them?</emphasis>
	</para>

   <para>
	One of the best diagnostic tools for debugging problems is Samba itself.  
	You can use the -d option for both smbd and nmbd to specify what 
	'debug level' at which to run.  See the man pages on smbd, nmbd  and 
	smb.conf for more information on debugging options.  The debug 
	level can range from 1 (the default) to 10 (100 for debugging passwords).
	</para>
	
	<para>
	Another helpful method of debugging is to compile samba using the 
	<command>gcc -g </command> flag.   This will include debug 
	information in the binaries and allow you to attach gdb to the 
	running smbd / nmbd process.  In order to attach gdb to an smbd 
	process for an NT workstation, first get the workstation to make the 
	connection. Pressing ctrl-alt-delete and going down to the domain box 
	is sufficient (at least, on the first time you join the domain) to 
	generate a 'LsaEnumTrustedDomains'. Thereafter, the workstation 
	maintains an open connection, and therefore there will be an smbd 
	process running (assuming that you haven't set a really short smbd 
	idle timeout)  So, in between pressing ctrl alt delete, and actually 
	typing in your password, you can gdb attach and continue.

<sect1>
<title>Domain Control for Windows 9x/ME</title>

<note>
<para>
The following section contains much of the original 
DOMAIN.txt file previously included with Samba.  Much of 
the material is based on what went into the book <emphasis>Special 
Edition, Using Samba</emphasis>, by Richard Sharpe.
</para>
</note>

<para>
A domain and a workgroup are exactly the same thing in terms of network
browsing.  The difference is that a distributable authentication
database is associated with a domain, for secure login access to a
network.  Also, different access rights can be granted to users if they
successfully authenticate against a domain logon server (NT server and 
other systems based on NT server support this, as does at least Samba TNG now).
</para>

<para>
The SMB client logging on to a domain has an expectation that every other
server in the domain should accept the same authentication information.
Network browsing functionality of domains and workgroups is
identical and is explained in BROWSING.txt. It should be noted, that browsing
is totally orthogonal to logon support.
</para>

<para>
Issues related to the single-logon network model are discussed in this
section.  Samba supports domain logons, network logon scripts, and user
profiles for MS Windows for workgroups and MS Windows 9X/ME clients
which will be the focus of this section.
</para>


<para>
When an SMB client in a domain wishes to logon it broadcast requests for a
logon server.  The first one to reply gets the job, and validates its
password using whatever mechanism the Samba administrator has installed.
It is possible (but very stupid) to create a domain where the user
database is not shared between servers, i.e. they are effectively workgroup
servers advertising themselves as participating in a domain.  This
demonstrates how authentication is quite different from but closely
involved with domains.
</para>


<para>
Using these features you can make your clients verify their logon via
the Samba server; make clients run a batch file when they logon to
the network and download their preferences, desktop and start menu.
</para>

<para>
Before launching into the configuration instructions, it is 
worthwhile lookingat how a Windows 9x/ME client performs a logon:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
	<para>
	The client broadcasts (to the IP broadcast address of the subnet it is in)
	a NetLogon request. This is sent to the NetBIOS name DOMAIN<1c> at the
	NetBIOS layer.  The client chooses the first response it receives, which
	contains the NetBIOS name of the logon server to use in the format of 
	\\SERVER.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then connects to that server, logs on (does an SMBsessetupX) and
	then connects to the IPC$ share (using an SMBtconX).
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then does a NetWkstaUserLogon request, which retrieves the name
	of the user's logon script. 
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then connects to the NetLogon share and searches for this 	
	and if it is found and can be read, is retrieved and executed by the client.
	After this, the client disconnects from the NetLogon share.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then sends a NetUserGetInfo request to the server, to retrieve
	the user's home share, which is used to search for profiles. Since the
	response to the NetUserGetInfo request does not contain much more 	
	the user's home share, profiles for Win9X clients MUST reside in the user
	home directory.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then connects to the user's home share and searches for the 
	user's profile. As it turns out, you can specify the user's home share as
	a sharename and path. For example, \\server\fred\.profile.
	If the profiles are found, they are implemented.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	The client then disconnects from the user's home share, and reconnects to
	the NetLogon share and looks for CONFIG.POL, the policies file. If this is
	found, it is read and implemented.
	</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>


<sect2>
<title>Configuration Instructions:	Network Logons</title>

<para>
The main difference between a PDC and a Windows 9x logon 
server configuration is that
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
Password encryption is not required for a Windows 9x logon server.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Windows 9x/ME clients do not possess machine trust accounts.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
Therefore, a Samba PDC will also act as a Windows 9x logon 
server.
</para>


<warning>
<title>security mode and master browsers</title>

<para>
There are a few comments to make in order to tie up some 
loose ends.  There has been much debate over the issue of whether
or not it is ok to configure Samba as a Domain Controller in security
modes other than <constant>USER</constant>.  The only security mode 
which  will not work due to technical reasons is <constant>SHARE</constant>
mode security.  <constant>DOMAIN</constant> and <constant>SERVER</constant>
mode security is really just a variation on SMB user level security.
</para>

<para>
Actually, this issue is also closely tied to the debate on whether 
or not Samba must be the domain master browser for its workgroup
when operating as a DC.  While it may technically be possible
to configure a server as such (after all, browsing and domain logons
are two distinctly different functions), it is not a good idea to
so.  You should remember that the DC must register the DOMAIN#1b NetBIOS 
name.  This is the name used by Windows clients to locate the DC.
Windows clients do not distinguish between the DC and the DMB.
For this reason, it is very wise to configure the Samba DC as the DMB.
</para>

<para>
Now back to the issue of configuring a Samba DC to use a mode other
than "security = user".  If a Samba host is configured to use 
another SMB server or DC in order to validate user connection 
requests, then it is a fact that some other machine on the network 
(the "password server") knows more about user than the Samba host.
99% of the time, this other host is a domain controller.  Now 
in order to operate in domain mode security, the "workgroup" parameter
must be set to the name of the Windows NT domain (which already 
has a domain controller, right?)
</para>

<para>
Therefore configuring a Samba box as a DC for a domain that 
already by definition has a PDC is asking for trouble.
Therefore, you should always configure the Samba DC to be the DMB
for its domain.
</para>
</warning>

<sect2>
<title>Configuration Instructions:	Setting up Roaming User Profiles</title>

<warning>
<para>
<emphasis>NOTE!</emphasis> Roaming profiles support is different 
for Win9X and WinNT.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
Before discussing how to configure roaming profiles, it is useful to see how
Win9X and WinNT clients implement these features.
</para>

<para>
Win9X clients send a NetUserGetInfo request to the server to get the user's
profiles location. However, the response does not have room for a separate 
profiles location field, only the user's home share. This means that Win9X 
profiles are restricted to being in the user's home directory.
</para>


<para>
WinNT clients send a NetSAMLogon RPC request, which contains many fields, 
including a separate field for the location of the user's profiles. 
This means that support for profiles is different for Win9X and WinNT.
</para>



<sect3>
<title>Windows NT Configuration</title>

<para>
To support WinNT clients, in the [global] section of smb.conf set the
following (for example):
</para>

<para><programlisting>
logon path = \\profileserver\profileshare\profilepath\%U\moreprofilepath
</programlisting></para>

<para>
The default for this option is \\%N\%U\profile, namely
\\sambaserver\username\profile.  The \\N%\%U service is created
automatically by the [homes] service.
If you are using a samba server for the profiles, you _must_ make the
share specified in the logon path browseable. 
</para>

<note>
<para>
[lkcl 26aug96 - we have discovered a problem where Windows clients can
maintain a connection to the [homes] share in between logins.  The
[homes] share must NOT therefore be used in a profile path.]
</para>
</note>

</sect3>


<sect3>
<title>Windows 9X Configuration</title>

<para>
To support Win9X clients, you must use the "logon home" parameter. Samba has
now been fixed so that "net use/home" now works as well, and it, too, relies
on the "logon home" parameter.
</para>

<para>
By using the logon home parameter, you are restricted to putting Win9X 
profiles in the user's home directory.   But wait! There is a trick you 
can use. If you set the following in the [global] section of your 
smb.conf file:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
logon home = \\%L\%U\.profiles
</programlisting></para>

<para>
then your Win9X clients will dutifully put their clients in a subdirectory
of your home directory called .profiles (thus making them hidden).
</para>

<para>
Not only that, but 'net use/home' will also work, because of a feature in 
Win9X. It removes any directory stuff off the end of the home directory area
and only uses the server and share portion. That is, it looks like you
specified \\%L\%U for "logon home".
</para>


</sect3>


<sect3>
<title>Win9X and WinNT Configuration</title>

<para>
You can support profiles for both Win9X and WinNT clients by setting both the
"logon home" and "logon path" parameters. For example:
</para>

<para><programlisting>
logon home = \\%L\%U\.profiles
logon path = \\%L\profiles\%U
</programlisting></para>

<note>
<para>
I have not checked what 'net use /home' does on NT when "logon home" is
set as above.
</para>
</note>

<sect3>
<title>Windows 9X Profile Setup</title>

<para>
When a user first logs in on Windows 9X, the file user.DAT is created,
as are folders "Start Menu", "Desktop", "Programs" and "Nethood".  
These directories and their contents will be merged with the local
versions stored in c:\windows\profiles\username on subsequent logins,
taking the most recent from each.  You will need to use the [global]
options "preserve case = yes", "short preserve case = yes" and
"case sensitive = no" in order to maintain capital letters in shortcuts
in any of the profile folders.
</para>


<para>
The user.DAT file contains all the user's preferences.  If you wish to
enforce a set of preferences, rename their user.DAT file to user.MAN,
and deny them write access to this file.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
	<para>
	On the Windows 95 machine, go to Control Panel | Passwords and
	select the User Profiles tab.  Select the required level of
	roaming preferences.  Press OK, but do _not_ allow the computer
	to reboot.
	</para>
</listitem>


<listitem>
	<para>
	On the Windows 95 machine, go to Control Panel | Network |
	Client for Microsoft Networks | Preferences.  Select 'Log on to
	NT Domain'.  Then, ensure that the Primary Logon is 'Client for
	Microsoft Networks'.  Press OK, and this time allow the computer
	to reboot.
	</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>
Under Windows 95, Profiles are downloaded from the Primary Logon.
If you have the Primary Logon as 'Client for Novell Networks', then
the profiles and logon script will be downloaded from your Novell
Server.  If you have the Primary Logon as 'Windows Logon', then the
profiles will be loaded from the local machine - a bit against the
concept of roaming profiles, if you ask me.
</para>

<para>
You will now find that the Microsoft Networks Login box contains
[user, password, domain] instead of just [user, password].  Type in
the samba server's domain name (or any other domain known to exist,
but bear in mind that the user will be authenticated against this
domain and profiles downloaded from it, if that domain logon server
supports it), user name and user's password.
</para>

<para>
Once the user has been successfully validated, the Windows 95 machine
will inform you that 'The user has not logged on before' and asks you
if you wish to save the user's preferences?  Select 'yes'.
</para>

<para>
Once the Windows 95 client comes up with the desktop, you should be able
to examine the contents of the directory specified in the "logon path"
on the samba server and verify that the "Desktop", "Start Menu",
"Programs" and "Nethood" folders have been created.
</para>

<para>
These folders will be cached locally on the client, and updated when
the user logs off (if you haven't made them read-only by then :-).
You will find that if the user creates further folders or short-cuts,
that the client will merge the profile contents downloaded with the
contents of the profile directory already on the local client, taking
the newest folders and short-cuts from each set.
</para>

<para>
If you have made the folders / files read-only on the samba server,
then you will get errors from the w95 machine on logon and logout, as
it attempts to merge the local and the remote profile.  Basically, if
you have any errors reported by the w95 machine, check the Unix file
permissions and ownership rights on the profile directory contents,
on the samba server.
</para>

<para>
If you have problems creating user profiles, you can reset the user's
local desktop cache, as shown below.  When this user then next logs in,
they will be told that they are logging in "for the first time".

If you have access to an NT server, then first set up roaming profiles
and / or netlogons on the NT server.  Make a packet trace, or examine
the example packet traces provided with NT server, and see what the

<title>Windows NT Workstation 4.0</title>

<para>
When a user first logs in to a Windows NT Workstation, the profile
NTuser.DAT is created.  The profile location can be now specified
through the "logon path" parameter.  
</para>

<note>
<para>
[lkcl 10aug97 - i tried setting the path to
\\samba-server\homes\profile, and discovered that this fails because
a background process maintains the connection to the [homes] share
which does _not_ close down in between user logins.  you have to
have \\samba-server\%L\profile, where user is the username created
from the [homes] share].
</para>
</note>

<para>
There is a parameter that is now available for use with NT Profiles:
"logon drive".  This should be set to "h:" or any other drive, and
should be used in conjunction with the new "logon home" parameter.
</para>

<para>
The entry for the NT 4.0 profile is a _directory_ not a file.  The NT
help on profiles mentions that a directory is also created with a .PDS
extension.  The user, while logging in, must have write permission to
create the full profile path (and the folder with the .PDS extension)
[lkcl 10aug97 - i found that the creation of the .PDS directory failed,
and had to create these manually for each user, with a shell script.
also, i presume, but have not tested, that the full profile path must
be browseable just as it is for w95, due to the manner in which they
attempt to create the full profile path: test existence of each path
component; create path component].
</para>

<para>
In the profile directory, NT creates more folders than 95.  It creates
"Application Data" and others, as well as "Desktop", "Nethood",
"Start Menu" and "Programs".  The profile itself is stored in a file
NTuser.DAT.  Nothing appears to be stored in the .PDS directory, and
its purpose is currently unknown.
</para>

<para>
You can use the System Control Panel to copy a local profile onto
a samba server (see NT Help on profiles: it is also capable of firing
up the correct location in the System Control Panel for you).  The
NT Help file also mentions that renaming NTuser.DAT to NTuser.MAN
turns a profile into a mandatory one.
</para>

<note>
<para>
[lkcl 10aug97 - i notice that NT Workstation tells me that it is
downloading a profile from a slow link.  whether this is actually the
case, or whether there is some configuration issue, as yet unknown,
that makes NT Workstation _think_ that the link is a slow one is a
matter to be resolved].
</para>

<para>
[lkcl 20aug97 - after samba digest correspondence, one user found, and
another confirmed, that profiles cannot be loaded from a samba server
unless "security = user" and "encrypt passwords = yes" (see the file
ENCRYPTION.txt) or "security = server" and "password server = ip.address.
of.yourNTserver" are used.  Either of these options will allow the NT
workstation to access the samba server using LAN manager encrypted
passwords, without the user intervention normally required by NT
workstation for clear-text passwords].
</para>

<para>
[lkcl 25aug97 - more comments received about NT profiles: the case of
the profile _matters_.  the file _must_ be called NTuser.DAT or, for
a mandatory profile, NTuser.MAN].

<title>Windows NT Server</title>

<para>
There is nothing to stop you specifying any path that you like for the
location of users' profiles.  Therefore, you could specify that the
profile be stored on a samba server, or any other SMB server, as long as
that SMB server supports encrypted passwords.

<title>Sharing Profiles between W95 and NT Workstation 4.0</title>

<para>
I think this is all bogus, but have not deleted it. (Richard Sharpe)
</para>
</warning>

<para>
The default logon path is \\%N\U%.  NT Workstation will attempt to create
a directory "\\samba-server\username.PDS" if you specify the logon path
as "\\samba-server\username" with the NT User Manager.  Therefore, you
will need to specify (for example) "\\samba-server\username\profile".
NT 4.0 will attempt to create "\\samba-server\username\profile.PDS", which
is more likely to succeed.
</para>

<para>
If you then want to share the same Start Menu / Desktop with W95, you will
need to specify "logon path = \\samba-server\username\profile" [lkcl 10aug97
this has its drawbacks: i created a shortcut to telnet.exe, which attempts
to run from the c:\winnt\system32 directory.  this directory is obviously
unlikely to exist on a Win95-only host].
</para>

<para>

If you have this set up correctly, you will find separate user.DAT and
NTuser.DAT files in the same profile directory.
</para>

<note>
<para>
[lkcl 25aug97 - there are some issues to resolve with downloading of
NT profiles, probably to do with time/date stamps.  i have found that
NTuser.DAT is never updated on the workstation after the first time that
it is copied to the local workstation profile directory.  this is in
contrast to w95, where it _does_ transfer / update profiles correctly].

<para>
<emphasis>NOTE :</emphasis> 
The term "Domain Controller" and those related to it refer to one specific
method of authentication that can underly an SMB domain. Domain Controllers
prior to Windows NT Server 3.1 were sold by various companies and based on 
private extensions to the LAN Manager 2.1 protocol. Windows NT introduced
Microsoft-specific ways of distributing the user authentication database.
See DOMAIN.txt for examples of how Samba can participate in or create
SMB domains based on shared authentication database schemes other than the 
Windows NT SAM.
</para>

<para>
Windows NT Server can be installed as either a plain file and print server
(WORKGROUP workstation or server) or as a server that participates in Domain
Control (DOMAIN member, Primary Domain controller or Backup Domain controller).
The same is true for OS/2 Warp Server, Digital Pathworks and other similar
products, all of which can participate in Domain Control along with Windows NT.
</para>

<para>
To many people these terms can be confusing, so let's try to clear the air.
</para>

<para>
Every Windows NT system (workstation or server) has a registry database.
The registry contains entries that describe the initialization information
for all services (the equivalent of Unix Daemons) that run within the Windows
NT environment. The registry also contains entries that tell application
software where to find dynamically loadable libraries that they depend upon.
In fact, the registry contains entries that describes everything that anything
may need to know to interact with the rest of the system.
</para>

<para>
The registry files can be located on any Windows NT machine by opening a
command prompt and typing:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>C:\WINNT\></prompt> dir %SystemRoot%\System32\config
</para>

<para>
The environment variable %SystemRoot% value can be obtained by typing:
</para>

<para>
<prompt>C:\WINNT></prompt>echo %SystemRoot%
</para>

<para>
The active parts of the registry that you may want to be familiar with are
the files called: default, system, software, sam and security.
</para>

<para>
In a domain environment, Microsoft Windows NT domain controllers participate
in replication of the SAM and SECURITY files so that all controllers within
the domain have an exactly identical copy of each.
</para>

<para>
The Microsoft Windows NT system is structured within a security model that
says that all applications and services must authenticate themselves before
they can obtain permission from the security manager to do what they set out
to do.
</para>

<para>
The Windows NT User database also resides within the registry. This part of
the registry contains the user's security identifier, home directory, group
memberships, desktop profile, and so on.
</para>

<para>
Every Windows NT system (workstation as well as server) will have its own
registry. Windows NT Servers that participate in Domain Security control
have a database that they share in common - thus they do NOT own an
independent full registry database of their own, as do Workstations and
plain Servers.
</para>

<para>
The User database is called the SAM (Security Access Manager) database and
is used for all user authentication as well as for authentication of inter-
process authentication (i.e. to ensure that the service action a user has
requested is permitted within the limits of that user's privileges).
</para>

<para>
The Samba team have produced a utility that can dump the Windows NT SAM into 
smbpasswd format: see ENCRYPTION.txt for information on smbpasswd and
/pub/samba/pwdump on your nearest Samba mirror for the utility. This 
facility is useful but cannot be easily used to implement SAM replication
to Samba systems.
</para>

<para>
Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT Workstations and Servers
can participate in a Domain security system that is controlled by Windows NT
servers that have been correctly configured. Almost every domain will have
ONE Primary Domain Controller (PDC). It is desirable that each domain will
have at least one Backup Domain Controller (BDC).
</para>

<para>
The PDC and BDCs then participate in replication of the SAM database so that
each Domain Controlling participant will have an up to date SAM component
within its registry.
