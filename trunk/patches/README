For now, I've adopted the naming convention of <nnn>-<description>.diff.
The Makefile will grab anything ending in ".diff" in this directory.
Ideally, a description should be included in this file with a bug
number where appropriate.  It'd also be nice to note for which build
the patch was added (i.e. added for samba-38).

Description of the patches in this directory:

000-build-issues.diff

    Adresses installman.sh failing when /usr/share doesn't exist.
    Also changes configure time detection of endian issues to compile
    time.  Added for samba-3.0.0b2 import (samba-39).
