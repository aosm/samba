<title>PAM based Distributed Authentication</title>

<para>
This chapter you should help you to deploy winbind based authentication on any PAM enabled
UNIX/Linux system. Winbind can be used to enable user level application access authentication
from any MS Windows NT Domain, MS Windows 200x Active Directory based domain, or any Samba
based domain environment. It will also help you to configure PAM based local host access
controls that are appropriate to your Samba configuration.
</para>

<para>
In addition to knowing how to configure winbind into PAM, you will learn generic PAM management
possibilities and in particular how to deploy tools like pam_smbpass.so to your advantage.
</para>

<note><para>
The use of Winbind require more than PAM configuration alone. Please refer to <link linkend="winbind">the Winbind chapter</link>.

<title>Features and Benefits</title>

<para>
A number of UNIX systems (eg: Sun Solaris), as well as the xxxxBSD family and Linux,
now utilize the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) facility to provide all authentication, 
authorization and resource control services. Prior to the introduction of PAM, a decision
to use an alternative to the system password database (<filename>/etc/passwd</filename>) 
would require the provision of alternatives for all programs that provide security services.
Such a choice would involve provision of alternatives to such programs as: <command>login</command>, 
<command>passwd</command>, <command>chown</command>, etc.
</para>

<para>
PAM provides a mechanism that disconnects these security programs from the underlying
authentication/authorization infrastructure.  PAM is configured either through one file
<filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> (Solaris), or by editing individual files that are
located in <filename>/etc/pam.d</filename>.
</para>

<para>
On PAM enabled UNIX/Linux systems it is an easy matter to configure the system to use any
authentication backend, so long as the appropriate dynamically loadable library modules
are available for it. The backend may be local to the system, or may be centralised on a
remote server.
</para>

<para>
PAM support modules are available for:
</para>

<variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term><filename>/etc/passwd</filename>:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		There are several PAM modules that interact with this standard UNIX user
		database. The most common are called: pam_unix.so, pam_unix2.so, pam_pwdb.so
		and pam_userdb.so.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Kerberos:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The pam_krb5.so module allows the use of any Kerberos compliant server.
		This tool is used to access MIT Kerberos, Heimdal Kerberos, and potentially
		Microsoft Active Directory (if enabled).
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>LDAP:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The pam_ldap.so module allows the use of any LDAP v2 or v3 compatible backend
		server. Commonly used LDAP backend servers include: OpenLDAP v2.0 and v2.1,
		Sun ONE iDentity server, Novell eDirectory server, Microsoft Active Directory.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>NetWare Bindery:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The pam_ncp_auth.so module allows authentication off any bindery enabled
		NetWare Core Protocol based server.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>SMB Password:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		This module, called pam_smbpass.so, will allow user authentication off
		the passdb backend that is configured in the Samba &smb.conf; file.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>SMB Server:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The pam_smb_auth.so module is the original MS Windows networking authentication
		tool. This module has been somewhat outdated by the Winbind module.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Winbind:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The pam_winbind.so module allows Samba to obtain authentication from any
		MS Windows Domain Controller. It can just as easily be used to authenticate
		users for access to any PAM enabled application.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>RADIUS:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		There is a PAM RADIUS (Remote Access Dial-In User Service) authentication
		module. In most cases the administrator will need to locate the source code
		for this tool and compile and install it themselves. RADIUS protocols are
		used by many routers and terminal servers.
		</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
Of the above, Samba provides the pam_smbpasswd.so and the pam_winbind.so modules alone.
</para>

<para>
Once configured, these permit a remarkable level of flexibility in the location and use
of distributed samba domain controllers that can provide wide are network bandwidth
efficient authentication services for PAM capable systems. In effect, this allows the
deployment of centrally managed and maintained distributed authentication from a single
user account database.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Technical Discussion</title>

<para>
PAM is designed to provide the system administrator with a great deal of flexibility in
configuration of the privilege granting applications of their system. The local
configuration of system security controlled by PAM is contained in one of two places:
either the single system file, /etc/pam.conf; or the /etc/pam.d/ directory.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>PAM Configuration Syntax</title>

<para>
In this section we discuss the correct syntax of and generic options respected by entries to these files.
PAM specific tokens in the configuration file are case insensitive. The module paths, however, are case
sensitive since they indicate a file's name and reflect the case dependence of typical file-systems.
The case-sensitivity of the arguments to any given module is defined for each module in turn.
</para>

<para>
In addition to the lines described below, there are two special characters provided for the convenience
of the system administrator: comments are preceded by a `#' and extend to the next end-of-line; also,
module specification lines may be extended with a `\' escaped newline. 
</para>

<para>
If the PAM authentication module (loadable link library file) is located in the
default location then it is not necessary to specify the path. In the case of
Linux, the default location is <filename>/lib/security</filename>. If the module
is located outside the default then the path must be specified as:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
auth  required  /other_path/pam_strange_module.so
</programlisting>
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Anatomy of <filename>/etc/pam.d</filename> Entries</title>

<para>
The remaining information in this subsection was taken from the documentation of the Linux-PAM
project. For more information on PAM, see 
<ulink url="http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">The Official Linux-PAM home page</ulink>
</para>

<para>
A general configuration line of the /etc/pam.conf file has the following form:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>
service-name   module-type   control-flag   module-path   args
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Below, we explain the meaning of each of these tokens. The second (and more recently adopted)
way of configuring Linux-PAM is via the contents of the <filename>/etc/pam.d/</filename> directory.
Once we have explained the meaning of the above tokens, we will describe this method.
</para>

<variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>service-name:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The name of the service associated with this entry. Frequently the service name is the conventional
		name of the given application. For example, `ftpd', `rlogind' and `su', etc. .
		</para>

		<para>
		There is a special service-name, reserved for defining a default authentication mechanism. It has
		the name `OTHER' and may be specified in either lower or upper case characters. Note, when there
		is a module specified for a named service, the `OTHER' entries are ignored.
		</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>module-type:</term><listitem>
                <para>
		One of (currently) four types of module. The four types are as follows:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>auth:</emphasis> this module type provides two aspects of authenticating the user.
			Firstly, it establishes that the user is who they claim to be, by instructing the application
			to prompt the user for a password or other means of identification. Secondly, the module can
			grant group membership (independently of the <filename>/etc/groups</filename> file discussed
			above) or other privileges through its credential granting properties.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>account:</emphasis> this module performs non-authentication based account management.
			It is typically used to restrict/permit access to a service based on the time of day, currently
		 	available system resources (maximum number of users) or perhaps the location of the applicant
			user `root' login only on the console.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>session:</emphasis> primarily, this module is associated with doing things that need
			to be done for the user before/after they can be given service. Such things include the logging
			of information concerning the opening/closing of some data exchange with a user, mounting
			directories, etc.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>password:</emphasis> this last module type is required for updating the authentication
			token associated with the user. Typically, there is one module for each `challenge/response'
			based authentication (auth) module-type.
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>control-flag:</term><listitem>
                <para>
		The control-flag is used to indicate how the PAM library will react to the success or failure of the
		module it is associated with. Since modules can be stacked (modules of the same type execute in series,
		one after another), the control-flags determine the relative importance of each module. The application
		is not made aware of the individual success or failure of modules listed in the
		<filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> file. Instead, it receives a summary success or fail response from
		the Linux-PAM library. The order of execution of these modules is that of the entries in the
		<filename>/etc/pam.conf</filename> file; earlier entries are executed before later ones.
		As of Linux-PAM v0.60, this control-flag can be defined with one of two syntaxes.
		</para>

		<para>
		The simpler (and historical) syntax for the control-flag is a single keyword defined to indicate the
		severity of concern associated with the success or failure of a specific module. There are four such
		<emphasis>keywords: required, requisite, sufficient and optional</emphasis>.
		</para>

		<para>
		The Linux-PAM library interprets these keywords in the following manner:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>required:</emphasis> this indicates that the success of the module is required for the
			module-type facility to succeed. Failure of this module will not be apparent to the user until all
			of the remaining modules (of the same module-type) have been executed.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>requisite:</emphasis> like required, however, in the case that such a module returns a
			failure, control is directly returned to the application. The return value is that associated with
			the first required or requisite module to fail. Note, this flag can be used to protect against the
			possibility of a user getting the opportunity to enter a password over an unsafe medium. It is
			conceivable that such behavior might inform an attacker of valid accounts on a system. This
			possibility should be weighed against the not insignificant concerns of exposing a sensitive
			password in a hostile environment.
			</para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>sufficient:</emphasis> the success of this module is deemed `sufficient' to satisfy
			the Linux-PAM library that this module-type has succeeded in its purpose. In the event that no
			previous required module has failed, no more `stacked' modules of this type are invoked. (Note,
			in this case subsequent required modules are not invoked.). A failure of this module is not deemed
			as fatal to satisfying the application that this module-type has succeeded.
			</para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>optional:</emphasis> as its name suggests, this control-flag marks the module as not
			being critical to the success or failure of the user's application for service. In general,
			Linux-PAM ignores such a module when determining if the module stack will succeed or fail.
			However, in the absence of any definite successes or failures of previous or subsequent stacked
			modules this module will determine the nature of the response to the application. One example of
			this latter case, is when the other modules return something like PAM_IGNORE.
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
		The more elaborate (newer) syntax is much more specific and gives the administrator a great deal of control
		over how the user is authenticated. This form of the control flag is delimited with square brackets and
		consists of a series of value=action tokens:
		</para>

<para><programlisting>
[value1=action1 value2=action2 ...]
</programlisting></para>

		<para>
		Here, value1 is one of the following return values: success; open_err; symbol_err; service_err;
		system_err; buf_err; perm_denied; auth_err; cred_insufficient; authinfo_unavail; user_unknown; maxtries;
		new_authtok_reqd; acct_expired; session_err; cred_unavail; cred_expired; cred_err; no_module_data; conv_err;
		authtok_err; authtok_recover_err; authtok_lock_busy; authtok_disable_aging; try_again; ignore; abort;
		authtok_expired; module_unknown; bad_item; and default. The last of these (default) can be used to set
		the action for those return values that are not explicitly defined.
		</para>

		<para>
		The action1 can be a positive integer or one of the following tokens: ignore; ok; done; bad; die; and reset.
		A positive integer, J, when specified as the action, can be used to indicate that the next J modules of the
		current module-type will be skipped. In this way, the administrator can develop a moderately sophisticated
		stack of modules with a number of different paths of execution. Which path is taken can be determined by the
		reactions of individual modules.
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>ignore:</emphasis> when used with a stack of modules, the module's return status will not
			contribute to the return code the application obtains.
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>bad:</emphasis> this action indicates that the return code should be thought of as indicative
			of the module failing. If this module is the first in the stack to fail, its status value will be used
			for that of the whole stack.
			</para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>die:</emphasis> equivalent to bad with the side effect of terminating the module stack and
			PAM immediately returning to the application.
			</para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>ok:</emphasis> this tells PAM that the administrator thinks this return code should
			contribute directly to the return code of the full stack of modules. In other words, if the former
			state of the stack would lead to a return of PAM_SUCCESS, the module's return code will override
			this value. Note, if the former state of the stack holds some value that is indicative of a modules
			failure, this 'ok' value will not be used to override that value.
			</para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>done:</emphasis> equivalent to ok with the side effect of terminating the module stack and
			PAM immediately returning to the application.
                        </para></listitem>

                        <listitem><para>
                        <emphasis>reset:</emphasis> clear all memory of the state of the module stack and start again with
			the next stacked module.
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
		Each of the four keywords: required; requisite; sufficient; and optional, have an equivalent expression in
		terms of the [...] syntax. They are as follows:
		</para>

		<para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			required is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad]
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			requisite is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=die]
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			sufficient is equivalent to [success=done new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore]
			</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>
			optional is equivalent to [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok default=ignore]
			</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		</para>

		<para>
		Just to get a feel for the power of this new syntax, here is a taste of what you can do with it. With Linux-PAM-0.63,
		the notion of client plug-in agents was introduced. This is something that makes it possible for PAM to support
		machine-machine authentication using the transport protocol inherent to the client/server application. With the
		<emphasis>[ ... value=action ... ]</emphasis> control syntax, it is possible for an application to be configured
		to support binary prompts with compliant clients, but to gracefully fall over into an alternative authentication
		mode for older, legacy, applications.
		</para>
		</listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>module-path:</term><listitem>
		<para>
		The path-name of the dynamically loadable object file; the pluggable module itself. If the first character of the
		module path is `/', it is assumed to be a complete path. If this is not the case, the given module path is appended
		to the default module path: <filename>/lib/security</filename> (but see the notes above).
		</para>

		<para>
		The args are a list of tokens that are passed to the module when it is invoked. Much like arguments to a typical
		Linux shell command. Generally, valid arguments are optional and are specific to any given module. Invalid arguments
		are ignored by a module, however, when encountering an invalid argument, the module is required to write an error
		to syslog(3). For a list of generic options see the next section.
		</para>

		<para>
		Note, if you wish to include spaces in an argument, you should surround that argument with square brackets. For example:
		</para>

<para><programlisting>
squid auth required pam_mysql.so user=passwd_query passwd=mada \
        db=eminence [query=select user_name from internet_service where \
                     user_name='%u' and password=PASSWORD('%p') and \
                     service='web_proxy']
</programlisting></para>

		<para>
		Note, when using this convention, you can include `[' characters inside the string, and if you wish to include a `]'
		character inside the string that will survive the argument parsing, you should use `\['. In other words:
		</para>

<para><programlisting><!--FIXME:Diagram-->
[..[..\]..]    -->   ..[..]..
</programlisting></para>

		<para>
		Any line in (one of) the configuration file(s), that is not formatted correctly, will generally tend (erring on the
		side of caution) to make the authentication process fail. A corresponding error is written to the system log files
		with a call to syslog(3).

<note><para>PAM allows stacking of authentication mechanisms. It is 
also possible to pass information obtained within one PAM module through 
to the next module in the PAM stack. Please refer to the documentation for 
your particular system implementation for details regarding the specific 
capabilities of PAM in this environment. Some Linux implementations also 
provide the <filename>pam_stack.so</filename> module that allows all 
authentication to be configured in a single central file. The 
<filename>pam_stack.so</filename> method has some very devoted followers 
on the basis that it allows for easier administration. As with all issues in 
life though, every decision makes trade-offs, so you may want examine the 
PAM documentation for further helpful information.

When Samba is configured to enable PAM support (i.e. 
<option>--with-pam</option>), this parameter will 
control whether or not Samba should obey PAM's account

is to use PAM for clear text authentication only and to 
ignore any account or session management. Note that Samba always 
ignores PAM for authentication in the case of 
<smbconfoption><name>encrypt passwords</name><value>yes</value></smbconfoption>. 
The reason is that PAM modules cannot support the challenge/response 
authentication mechanism needed in the presence of SMB

a  unix user or group, a mapping between rids and unix user and group ids is required. This
is one of the jobs that winbind performs.
</para>

<para>
As winbind users and groups are resolved from a server, user and group ids are allocated
from a specified range. This is done on a first come, first served basis, although all
existing users and groups will be mapped as soon as a client performs a user or  group 
enumeration command.  The allocated unix ids are stored in a database file under the Samba
lock directory and will be remembered.
</para>

<para>
The astute administrator will realize from this that the combination of <filename>pam_smbpass.so</filename>, 
<command>winbindd</command>, and a distributed passdb backend, such as ldap, will allow the establishment of a
centrally managed, distributed user/password database that can also be used by all PAM (eg: Linux) aware
programs and applications. This arrangement can have particularly potent advantages compared with the use of
Microsoft Active Directory Service (ADS) in so far as reduction of wide area network authentication traffic.
</para>

<warning><para>
The rid to unix id database is the only location where the user and group  mappings are 
stored by winbindd.  If this file is deleted or corrupted, there is no way for winbindd
to determine which user and group ids correspond to Windows NT user and group rids.

<title>Password Synchronization using pam_smbpass.so</title>

<para>
pam_smbpass is a PAM module which can be used on conforming systems to
keep the smbpasswd (Samba password) database in sync with the unix
password file. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an API supported
under some Unices, such as Solaris, HPUX and Linux, that provides a
generic interface to authentication mechanisms.
</para>

<para>
This module authenticates a local smbpasswd user database.  If you require
support for authenticating against a remote SMB server, or if you're
concerned about the presence of suid root binaries on your system, it is
recommended that you use pam_winbind instead.
</para>

		The problem may lie with your inclusion of <parameter>pam_stack.so
	service=system-auth</parameter>. That file often contains a lot of stuff that may
	duplicate what you're already doing. Try commenting out the pam_stack lines
	for auth and account and see if things work. If they do, look at
	<filename>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</filename> and copy only what you need from it into your
	<filename>/etc/pam.d/login</filename> file.  Alternatively, if you want all services to use
	winbind, you can put the winbind-specific stuff in <filename>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</filename>.
