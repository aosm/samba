.SH NAME
ntlm_auth \- tool to allow external access to Winbind's NTLM authentication function
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fBntlm_auth\fR [-d debuglevel] [-l logfile] [-s <smb config file>]
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This tool is part of the \fBSamba\fR(7) suite\&.

.PP
\fBntlm_auth\fR is a helper utility that authenticates users using NT/LM authentication\&. It returns 0 if the users is authenticated successfully and 1 if access was denied\&. ntlm_auth uses winbind to access the user and authentication data for a domain\&. This utility is only to be used by other programs (currently squid)\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
--helper-protocol=PROTO
Operate as a stdio-based helper


.TP
--username=USERNAME
Specify username of user to authenticate


.TP
--domain=DOMAIN
Specify domain of user to authenticate


.TP
--workstation=WORKSTATION
Specify the workstation the user authenticated from


.TP
--challenge=STRING
challenge (HEX encoded)


.TP
--lm-response=RESPONSE
LM Response to the challenge (HEX encoded)


.TP
--nt-response=RESPONSE
NT or NTLMv2 Response to the challenge (HEX encoded)


.TP
--password=PASSWORD
User's plaintext password


.TP
--request-lm-key
Retreive LM session key


.TP

.TP
-V
Prints the version number for \fBsmbd\fR\&.


.TP
-s <configuration file>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server\&. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide\&. See \fIsmb\&.conf\fR for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.


.TP
-d|--debug=debuglevel
\fIdebuglevel\fR is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero\&.


The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.


Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.


Note that specifying this parameter here will override the \fIlog level\fR parameter in the \fIsmb\&.conf\fR file\&.


.TP
-l|--logfile=logbasename
File name for log/debug files\&. The extension \fB"\&.client"\fR will be appended\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.


.TP
-h|--help
Print a summary of command line options\&.
