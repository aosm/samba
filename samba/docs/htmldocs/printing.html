Printing is often a mission-critical service for the users.  Samba can
provide this service reliably and seamlessly for a client network
consisting of Windows workstations.
</p><p>
A Samba print service may be run on a Standalone or a Domain
member server, side by side with file serving functions, or on a
dedicated print server. It can be made as tight or as loosely secured
as needs dictate. Configurations may be simple or complex.  Available
authentication schemes are essentially the same as described for file
services in previous chapters. Overall, Samba's printing support is
now able to replace an NT or Windows 2000 print server full-square,
with additional benefits in many cases. Clients may download and
install drivers and printers through their familiar &quot;Point'n'Print&quot;
mechanism. Printer installations executed by &quot;Logon Scripts&quot; are no
problem. Administrators can upload and manage drivers to be used by
clients through the familiar &quot;Add Printer Wizard&quot;. As an additional
benefit, driver and printer management may be run from the command line
or through scripts, making it more efficient in case of large numbers
of printers. If a central accounting of print jobs (tracking every
single page and supplying the raw data for all sorts of statistical
reports) is required, this is best supported by CUPS as the print
subsystem underneath the Samba hood.
</p><p>
This chapter deals with the foundations of Samba printing, as they
implemented by the more traditional UNIX (BSD- and System V-style)
printing systems. Many things apply to CUPS, the newer Common UNIX
Printing System, too; so if you use CUPS, you might be tempted to jump
to the next chapter -- but you will certainly miss a few things if you
do so. Better to read this chapter too.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
Most of the given examples have been verified on Windows XP
Professional clients. Where this document describes the responses to
commands given, bear in mind that Windows 2000 clients are very
similar, but may differ in details. Windows NT is somewhat different
again.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2913045"></a>Technical Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Samba's printing support always relies on the installed print
subsystem of the UNIX OS it runs on. Samba is a &quot;middleman&quot;. It takes
printfiles from Windows (or other SMB) clients and passes them to the
real printing system for further processing. Therefore it needs to
&quot;talk&quot; to two sides: to the Windows print clients and to the UNIX
printing system. Hence we must differentiate between the various
client OS types each of which behave differently, as well as the
various UNIX print subsystems, which themselves have different
features and are accessed differently. This part of the Samba HOWTO
Collection deals with the &quot;traditional&quot; way of UNIX printing first;
the next chapter covers in great detail the more modern
<span class="emphasis"><em>Common UNIX Printing System</em></span>
(CUPS).

</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>CUPS users, be warned: don't just jump on to the next

To successfully print a job from a Windows client via a Samba
print server to a UNIX printer, there are 6 (potentially 7)
stages:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Windows opens a connection to the printer share</p></li><li><p>Samba must authenticate the user</p></li><li><p>Windows sends a copy of the printfile over the network
into Samba's spooling area</p></li><li><p>Windows closes the connection again</p></li><li><p>Samba invokes the print command to hand the file over
to the UNIX print subsystem's spooling area</p></li><li><p>The UNIX print subsystem processes the print
job</p></li><li><p>The printfile may need to be explicitly deleted
from the Samba spooling area.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2913154"></a>Printing Related Configuration Parameters</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
There are a number of configuration parameters in
 controlling Samba's printing
behaviour. Please also refer to the man page for smb.conf to
acquire an overview about these. As with other parameters, there are
Global Level (tagged with a &quot;<span class="emphasis"><em>G</em></span>&quot; in the listings) and
Service Level (&quot;<span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>&quot;) parameters.
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Service Level Parameters</span></dt><dd><p>These <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> go into the

Samba's printing support implements the Microsoft Remote Procedure
Calls (MS-RPC) methods for printing. These are used by Windows NT (and
later) print servers. The old &quot;LanMan&quot; protocol is still supported as
a fallback resort, and for older clients to use.  More details will
follow further beneath.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2913718"></a>A simple Configuration to Print</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Here is a very simple example configuration for print related settings
in the  file. If you compare it with your own system's , you probably find some
additional parameters included there (as pre-configured by your OS
vendor). Further below is a discussion and explanation of the
parameters. Note, that this example doesn't use many parameters.
However, in many environments these are enough to provide a valid
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file which enables all clients to print.
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2913746"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 18.1. Simple configuration with BSD printing</b></p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printing = bsd</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>path = /var/spool/samba</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printable = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>public = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>writable = no</tt></i></td></tr></table></div><p>
This is only an example configuration. Samba assigns default values to all
configuration parameters. On the whole the defaults are conservative and
sensible. When a parameter is specified in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file this overwrites
the default value.  The <b class="command">testparm</b> utility when run as root
is capable of reporting all setting, both default as well as <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file
settings. <b class="command">Testparm</b> gives warnings for all mis-configured
settings. The complete output is easily 340 lines and more, so you may want
to pipe it through a pager program.
</p><p>
The syntax for the configuration file is easy to grasp. You should
know that  is not very picky about its
syntax. It has been explained elsewhere in this document. A short
reminder: It even tolerates some spelling errors (like &quot;browsable&quot;
instead of &quot;browseable&quot;). Most spelling is case-insensitive. Also, you
can use &quot;Yes|No&quot; or &quot;True|False&quot; for boolean settings. Lists of names
may be separated by commas, spaces or tabs.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2913883"></a>Verification of &quot;Settings in Use&quot; with <b class="command">testparm</b></h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
To see all (or at least most) printing related settings in Samba,
including the implicitly used ones, try the command outlined below
(hit &quot;ENTER&quot; twice!). It greps for all occurrences of &quot;lp&quot;, &quot;print&quot;,
&quot;spool&quot;, &quot;driver&quot;, &quot;ports&quot; and &quot;[&quot; in testparm's output and gives you
a nice overview about the running smbd's print configuration. (Note
that this command does not show individually created printer shares,
or the spooling paths in each case). Here is the output of my Samba
setup, with exactly the same settings in 
as shown above:
</p><pre class="screen">

You can easily verify which settings were implicitly added by Samba's
default behaviour. <span class="emphasis"><em>Don't forget about this point: it may
be important in your future dealings with Samba.</em></span>
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> testparm in samba 3 behaves differently from 2.2.x: used
without the &quot;-v&quot; switch it only shows you the settings actually
written into ! To see the complete
configuration used, add the &quot;-v&quot; parameter to testparm.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2914010"></a>A little Experiment to warn you</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Should you need to troubleshoot at any stage, please always come back
to this point first and verify if &quot;testparm&quot; shows the parameters you
expect! To give you an example from personal experience as a warning,
try to just &quot;comment out&quot; the <a class="indexterm" name="id2914020"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers</tt></i>&quot;
parameter. If your 2.2.x system behaves like mine, you'll see this:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt>grep &quot;load printers&quot; /etc/samba/smb.conf
 #      load printers = Yes
 # This setting is commented ooouuuuut!!
 
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt>testparm -v /etc/samba/smb.conf | egrep &quot;(load printers)&quot;
        load printers = Yes

</pre><p>
Despite my imagination that the commenting out of this setting should
prevent Samba from publishing my printers, it still did! Oh Boy -- it
cost me quite some time to find out the reason. But I am not fooled
any more... at least not by this ;-)
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>grep -A1 &quot;load printers&quot; /etc/samba/smb.conf</tt></b>
        load printers = No
        # This setting is what I mean!!
 #      load printers = Yes
        # This setting is commented ooouuuuut!!

<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>testparm -v smb.conf.simpleprinting | egrep &quot;(load printers)&quot;</tt></b>
        load printers = No

</pre><p>
Only when setting the parameter explicitly to
&quot;<a class="indexterm" name="id2914136"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers</tt></i> = No&quot;
would Samba recognize my intentions. So my strong advice is:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Never rely on &quot;commented out&quot; parameters!</p></li><li><p>Always set it up explicitly as you intend it to
behave.</p></li><li><p>Use <b class="command">testparm</b> to uncover hidden
settings which might not reflect your intentions.</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can have a working Samba print configuration with this
minimal :
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>cat /etc/samba/smb.conf-minimal</tt></b>
        [printers]

</pre><p>
This example should show you that you can use testparm to test any
filename for fitness as a Samba configuration. Actually, we want to
encourage you <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to change your
 on a working system (unless you know
exactly what you are doing)! Don't rely on an assumption that changes
will only take effect after you re-start smbd!  This is not the
case. Samba re-reads its  every 60
seconds and on each new client connection. You might have to face
changes for your production clients that you didn't intend to apply at
this time! You will now note a few more interesting things. Let's now
ask <b class="command">testparm</b> what the Samba print configuration
would be, if you used this minimalistic file as your real
:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>testparm -v smb.conf-minimal | egrep &quot;(print|lpq|spool|driver|ports|[)&quot;</tt></b>

However, this was not fatal, and samba will default to values that
will work here. Please, don't rely on this and don't use this
example! This was only meant to make you careful to design and specify
your setup to be what you really want it to be. The outcome on your
system may vary for some parameters, since you may have a Samba built
with a different compile-time configuration.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Warning:</em></span> don't put a comment sign <span class="emphasis"><em>at
the end</em></span> of a valid  line. It
will cause the parameter to be ignored (just as if you had put the
comment sign at the front). At first I regarded this as a bug in my
Samba version(s). But the man page states: &#8220;<span class="quote">Internal whitespace
in a parameter value is retained verbatim.</span>&#8221; This means that a
line consisting of, for example,
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td># This defines LPRng as the printing system&quot;</td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printing = lprng</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
will regard the whole of the string after the &quot;=&quot;

that will be ignored, and a default value used instead.]

may not find all the settings in your own

vendor). Many configuration parameters, if not explicitly set to a
specific value, are used and set by Samba implicitly to its own
default, because these have been compiled in. To see all settings, let
root use the <b class="command">testparm</b>

Following is a discussion of the settings from above shown example.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2914714"></a>The [global] Section</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The <i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section is one of 4 special
sections (along with [<i class="parameter"><tt>[homes]</tt></i>,
<i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> and
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>...) It contains all parameters which
apply to the server as a whole. It is the place for parameters which
have only a &quot;global&quot; meaning. It may also contain service level
parameters which then define default settings for all other
sections and shares. This way you can simplify the configuration and
avoid setting the same value repeatedly. (Within each individual
section or share you may however override these globally set &quot;share
level&quot; settings and specify other values).
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2914781"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = bsd</span></dt><dd><p> this causes Samba to use default print commands
applicable for the BSD (a.k.a. RFC 1179 style or LPR/LPD) printing
system. In general, the &quot;printing&quot; parameter informs Samba about the
print subsystem it should expect. Samba supports CUPS, LPD, LPRNG,
SYSV, HPUX, AIX, QNX and PLP. Each of these systems defaults to a
different <a class="indexterm" name="id2914801"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i> (and other queue control
commands).</p><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3><p>The <a class="indexterm" name="id2914838"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> parameter is
normally a service level parameter. Since it is included here in the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section, it will take effect for all
printer shares that are not defined differently. Samba 3 no longer
supports the SOFTQ printing system.</p></div></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2914868"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers</tt></i> = yes</span></dt><dd><p> this tells Samba to create automatically all
available printer shares. &quot;Available&quot; printer shares are discovered by
scanning the printcap file. All created printer shares are also loaded
for browsing. If you use this parameter, you do not need to specify
separate shares for each printer. Each automatically created printer
share will clone the configuration options found in the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> section. (A <i class="parameter"><tt>load printers
= no</tt></i> setting will allow you to specify each UNIX printer
you want to share separately, leaving out some you don't want to be
publicly visible and available).  </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2914927"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>show add printer wizard</tt></i> = yes </span></dt><dd><p> this setting is normally
enabled by default (even if the parameter is not written into the
). It makes the <span class="guiicon">Add Printer Wizard</span> icon
show up in the <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder of the Samba host's
share listing (as shown in <span class="guiicon">Network Neighbourhood</span> or
by the <b class="command">net view</b> command). To disable it, you need to
explicitly set it to <tt class="constant">no</tt> (commenting it out
will not suffice!). The Add Printer Wizard lets you upload printer
drivers to the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share and associate it
with a printer (if the respective queue exists there before the
action), or exchange a printer's driver against any other previously
uploaded driver.  </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2914996"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>total print jobs</tt></i> = 100</span></dt><dd><p> this setting sets the upper limit to 100 print jobs
being active on the Samba server at any one time. Should a client
submit a job which exceeds this number, a &#8220;<span class="quote">no more space
available on server</span>&#8221; type of error message will be returned by
Samba to the client. A setting of &quot;0&quot; (the default) means there is
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> limit at all!
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2915035"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap name</tt></i> = /etc/printcap</span></dt><dd><p> this tells Samba where to look for a list of
available printer names. (If you use CUPS, make sure that a printcap
file is written: this is controlled by the &quot;Printcap&quot; directive of
<tt class="filename">cupsd.conf</tt>).

drivers and set printer properties (&quot;ntadmin&quot; is only an example name,
it needs to be a valid UNIX group name); root is implicitly always a
<a class="indexterm" name="id2915102"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>. The &quot;@&quot; sign precedes group names in
. A printer admin can do anything to
printers via the remote administration interfaces offered by MS-RPC
(see below).  Note that the <a class="indexterm" name="id2915124"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>
parameter is normally a share level parameter, so you may associate
different groups to different printer shares in larger installations,
if you use the <a class="indexterm" name="id2915141"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> parameter on the
share levels).
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2915159"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>lpq cache time</tt></i> = 20</span></dt><dd><p> this controls the cache time for the results of the
lpq command. It prevents the lpq command being called too often and
reduces load on a heavily used print server.

default value is <tt class="constant">No</tt> (or <tt class="constant">False</tt>).
It must <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be enabled on print shares 
(with a <tt class="constant">yes</tt> or <tt class="constant">true</tt> setting) which
have valid drivers installed on the Samba server! For more detailed

This is the second special section. If a section with this name
appears in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>, users are able to
connect to any printer specified in the Samba host's printcap file,
because Samba on startup then creates a printer share for every
printername it finds in the printcap file. You could regard this
section as a general convenience shortcut to share all printers with
minimal configuration. It is also a container for settings which
should apply as default to all printers. (For more details see the
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> man page.) Settings inside this
container must be share level parameters.
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><a class="indexterm" name="id2915287"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>comment</tt></i> = All printers</span></dt><dd><p> the <a class="indexterm" name="id2915307"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>comment</tt></i> is shown next to

connected clients to open, write to and submit spool files into the

in the Explorer browse list. (Note that you will of course see the
individual printers).

connect to the printers service. Access will be granted with the
privileges of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2915513"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>guest account</tt></i>. On many systems the
guest account will map to a user named &quot;nobody&quot;. This user is in the UNIX
passwd file with an empty password, but with no valid UNIX login.
(Note: on some systems the guest account might not have the
privilege to be able to print. Test this by logging in as your
guest user using <b class="command">su - guest</b> and run a system print
command like

Since we have <a class="indexterm" name="id2915596"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok</tt></i> = yes,
it really doesn't need to be here! (This leads to the interesting
question: &#8220;<span class="quote">What, if I by accident have to contradictory settings
for the same share?</span>&#8221; The answer is: the last one encountered by
Samba wins. The &quot;winner&quot; is shown by testparm. Testparm doesn't
complain about different settings of the same parameter for the same
share! You can test this by setting up multiple lines for the &quot;guest
account&quot; parameter with different usernames, and then run testparm to
see which one is actually used by Samba.)

in a &quot;printable&quot; service, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> allowed to

only via print spooling operations. &quot;Normal&quot; write operations are not

If a section appears in the , which is
tagged as <a class="indexterm" name="id2915717"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printable</tt></i> = yes, Samba presents it as
a printer share to its clients. Note, that Win95/98/ME clients may
have problems with connecting or loading printer drivers if the share
name has more than 8 characters! Also be very careful if you give a
printer the same name as an existing user or file share name: upon a
client's connection request to a certain sharename, Samba always tries
to find file shares with that name first; if it finds one, it will
connect to this and will never ultimately connect to a printer with
the same name!

In each section defining a printer (or in the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> section), a <i class="parameter"><tt>print
command</tt></i> parameter may be defined. It sets a command to
process the files which have been placed into the Samba print spool
directory for that printer. (That spool directory was, if you
remember, set up with the <a class="indexterm" name="id2916055"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>path</tt></i>
parameter). Typically, this command will submit the spool file to the
Samba host's print subsystem, using the suitable system print
command. But there is no requirement that this needs to be the
case. For debugging purposes or some other reason you may want to do
something completely different than &quot;print&quot; the file. An example is a
command that just copies the print file to a temporary location for
further investigation when you need to debug printing. If you craft
your own print commands (or even develop print command shell scripts),
make sure you pay attention to the need to remove the files from the
Samba spool directory. Otherwise your hard disk may soon suffer from
shortage of free space.

You learned earlier on, that Samba in most cases uses its built-in
settings for many parameters if it can not find an explicitly stated
one in its configuration file. The same is true for the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2916122"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i>. The default print command varies
depending on the <a class="indexterm" name="id2916138"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> parameter
setting. In the commands listed below, you will notice some parameters
of the form <span class="emphasis"><em>%X</em></span> where <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is
<span class="emphasis"><em>p, s, J</em></span> etc. These letters stand for
&quot;printername&quot;, &quot;spoolfile&quot; and &quot;job ID&quot; respectively.  They are

We excluded the special CUPS case here, because it is discussed in the
next chapter. Just a short summary. For <i class="parameter"><tt>printing =
CUPS</tt></i>: If SAMBA is compiled against libcups, it uses the
CUPS API to submit jobs, etc. (It is a good idea also to set
<a class="indexterm" name="id2916676"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap</tt></i> = cups in case your
<tt class="filename">cupsd.conf</tt> is set to write its autogenerated
printcap file to an unusual place). Otherwise Samba maps to the System
V printing commands with the -oraw option for printing, i.e. it uses
<b class="command">lp -c -d%p -oraw; rm %s</b> With <i class="parameter"><tt>printing =
cups</tt></i> , and if SAMBA is compiled against libcups, any
manually set print command will be ignored!
</p><p>
Having listed the above mappings here, you should note that there used
to be a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> in recent 2.2.x versions which
prevented the mapping from taking effect. It lead to the
&quot;bsd|aix|lprng|plp&quot; settings taking effect for all other systems, for
the most important commands (the <b class="command">print</b> command, the
<b class="command">lpq</b> command and the <b class="command">lprm</b>
command). The <b class="command">lppause</b> command and the
<b class="command">lpresume</b> command remained empty. Of course, these
commands worked on bsd|aix|lprng|plp but they didn't work on
sysv|hpux|qnx systems. To work around this bug, you need to
explicitly set the commands. Use <b class="command">testparm -v</b> to
check which command takes effect. Then check that this command is
adequate and actually works for your installed print subsystem. It is
always a good idea to explicitly set up your configuration files the
way you want them to work and not rely on any built-in defaults.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2916791"></a>Setting up your own Print Commands</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
After a print job has finished spooling to a service, the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2916802"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i> will be used by Samba via a
<span class="emphasis"><em>system()</em></span> call to process the spool file.  Usually
the command specified will submit the spool file to the host's
printing subsystem. But there is no requirement at all that this must
be the case. The print subsystem will probably not remove the spool
file on its own. So whatever command you specify on your own you
should ensure that the spool file is deleted after it has been
processed.
</p><p>
There is no difficulty with using your own customized print commands
with the traditional printing systems. However, if you don't wish to
&quot;roll your own&quot;, you should be well informed about the default
built-in commands that Samba uses for each printing subsystem (see the
table above).  In all the commands listed in the last paragraphs you
see parameters of the form <span class="emphasis"><em>%X</em></span> These are
<span class="emphasis"><em>macros</em></span>, or shortcuts, used as place holders for
the names of real objects. At the time of running a command with such
a placeholder, Samba will insert the appropriate value
automatically. Print commands can handle all Samba macro
substitutions. In regard to printing, the following ones do have
special relevance:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%s, %f</tt></i> - the path to the spool
file name</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i> - the appropriate printer
name</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%J</tt></i> - the job name as
transmitted by the client.</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%c</tt></i> - the number of printed
pages of the spooled job (if known).</p></li><li><p><i class="parameter"><tt>%z</tt></i> - the size of the spooled
print job (in bytes)</p></li></ul></div><p>
The print command MUST contain at least one occurrence of
<i class="parameter"><tt>%s</tt></i> or <i class="parameter"><tt>%f</tt></i>. -- The
<i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i> is optional. If no printer name is supplied,
the <i class="parameter"><tt>%p</tt></i> will be silently removed from the print
command. In this case the job is sent to the default printer.
</p><p>
If specified in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section, the print
command given will be used for any printable service that does not
have its own print command specified. If there is neither a specified
print command for a printable service nor a global print command,
spool files will be created but not processed! And (most importantly):
print files will not be removed, so they will start filling your Samba
hard disk.
</p><p>
Note that printing may fail on some UNIXes from the &quot;nobody&quot;
account. If this happens, create an alternative guest account and
supply it with the privilege to print. Set up this guest account in
the <i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i> section with the <i class="parameter"><tt>guest
account</tt></i> parameter.
</p><p>
You can form quite complex print commands. You need to realize that
print commands are just passed to a UNIX shell. The shell is able to
expand the included environment variables as usual. (The syntax to
include a UNIX environment variable <i class="parameter"><tt>$variable</tt></i>
in  or in the Samba print command is
<i class="parameter"><tt>%$variable</tt></i>.) To give you a working
<a class="indexterm" name="id2917032"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i> example, the following will log a
print job to <tt class="filename">/tmp/print.log</tt>, print the file, then
remove it. Note that ';' is the usual separator for commands in shell
scripts:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>print command = echo Printing %s &gt;&gt; /tmp/print.log; lpr -P %p %s; rm %s</tt></i></td></tr></table><p>
You may have to vary your own command considerably from this example
depending on how you normally print files on your system.  The default
for the <a class="indexterm" name="id2917081"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i> parameter varies depending on the setting of
the <a class="indexterm" name="id2917098"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> parameter. Another example is:
</p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>print command = /usr/local/samba/bin/myprintscript %p %s</tt></i></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2917131"></a>Innovations in Samba Printing since 2.2</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Before version 2.2.0, Samba's print server support for Windows clients
was limited to the level of <span class="emphasis"><em>LanMan</em></span> printing
calls. This is the same protocol level as Windows 9x PCs offer when
they share printers.  Beginning with the 2.2.0 release, Samba started
to support the native Windows NT printing mechanisms. These are
implemented via <span class="emphasis"><em>MS-RPC</em></span> (RPC = <span class="emphasis"><em>Remote
Procedure Calls</em></span> ). MS-RPCs use the
<span class="emphasis"><em>SPOOLSS</em></span> named pipe for all printing.
</p><p>
The additional functionality provided by the new SPOOLSS support includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support for downloading printer driver files to Windows
95/98/NT/2000 clients upon demand (<span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span>);
</p></li><li><p>Uploading of printer drivers via the Windows NT
<span class="emphasis"><em>Add Printer Wizard</em></span> (APW) or the
<a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">Imprints</a> tool set.
</p></li><li><p>Support for the native MS-RPC printing calls such as
		StartDocPrinter, EnumJobs(), etc... (See the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_top">MSDN documentation</a> for more information on the Win32 printing API);</p></li><li><p>Support for NT <span class="emphasis"><em>Access Control
Lists</em></span> (ACL) on printer objects;</p></li><li><p>Improved support for printer queue manipulation
through the use of internal databases for spooled job information
(implemented by various <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt>
files).</p></li></ul></div><p>
One other benefit of an update is this: Samba 3 is able to publish
all its printers in Active Directory (or LDAP)!
</p><p>
One slight difference is here: it is possible on a Windows NT print
server to have printers listed in the Printers folder which are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> shared. Samba does not make this
distinction. By definition, the only printers of which Samba is aware
are those which are specified as shares in
. The reason is that Windows NT/200x/XP Professional
clients do not normally need to use the standard SMB printer share;
rather they can print directly to any printer on another Windows NT
host using MS-RPC. This of course assumes that the printing client has
the necessary privileges on the remote host serving the printer. The
default permissions assigned by Windows NT to a printer gives the
&quot;Print&quot; permissions to the well-known <span class="emphasis"><em>Everyone</em></span>
group. (The older clients of type Win9x can only print to &quot;shared&quot;
printers).
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2917292"></a>Client Drivers on Samba Server for <span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span></h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
There is still confusion about what all this means: <span class="emphasis"><em>Is it or
is it not a requirement for printer drivers to be installed on a Samba
host in order to support printing from Windows clients?</em></span> The
answer to this is: No, it is not a
<span class="emphasis"><em>requirement</em></span>. Windows NT/2000 clients can, of
course, also run their APW to install drivers
<span class="emphasis"><em>locally</em></span> (which then connect to a Samba served
print queue). This is the same method as used by Windows 9x
clients. (However, a <span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span> existed in Samba 2.2.0
which made Windows NT/2000 clients require that the Samba server
possess a valid driver for the printer. This was fixed in Samba
2.2.1).
</p><p>
But it is a new <span class="emphasis"><em>option</em></span> to install the printer
drivers into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share of the Samba
server, and a big convenience too. Then <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
clients (including 95/98/ME) get the driver installed when they first
connect to this printer share. The <span class="emphasis"><em>uploading</em></span> or
<span class="emphasis"><em>depositing</em></span> of the driver into this
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share, and the following binding of
this driver to an existing Samba printer share can be achieved by
different means:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>running the <span class="emphasis"><em>APW</em></span> on an
NT/200x/XP Professional client (this doesn't work from 95/98/ME
clients);</p></li><li><p>using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Imprints</em></span>
toolset;</p></li><li><p>using the <span class="emphasis"><em>smbclient</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>rpcclient</em></span> commandline tools;</p></li><li><p>using <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsaddsmb</em></span>(only works for
the CUPS printing system, not for LPR/LPD, LPRng
etc.).</p></li></ul></div><p>
Please take additional note of the following fact: <span class="emphasis"><em>Samba
does not use these uploaded drivers in any way to process spooled
files</em></span>. Drivers are utilized entirely by the clients, who
download and install them via the &quot;Point'n'Print&quot; mechanism supported
by Samba. The clients use these drivers to generate print files in the
format the printer (or the UNIX print system) requires. Print files
received by Samba are handed over to the UNIX printing system, which
is responsible for all further processing, if needed.

<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> vs. <i class="parameter"><tt>[printer$]</tt></i>
. </b>
Versions of Samba prior to 2.2 made it possible to use a share
named <span class="emphasis"><em>[printer$]</em></span>. This name was taken from the
same named service created by Windows 9x clients when a printer was
shared by them. Windows 9x printer servers always have a
<i class="parameter"><tt>[printer$]</tt></i> service which provides read-only
access (with no password required) in order to support printer driver
downloads.  However, Samba's initial implementation allowed for a
parameter named <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver location</tt></i> to be
used on a per share basis.  This specified the location of the driver
files associated with that printer. Another parameter named
<i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver</tt></i> provided a means of defining the
printer driver name to be sent to the client.  These parameters,
including the <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver file</tt></i> parameter,
are now removed and can not be used in installations of samba-3.
Now the share name <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> is used for the
location of downloadable printer drivers. It is taken from the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service created by Windows NT PCs when
a printer is shared by them. Windows NT print servers always have a
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service which provides read-write
access (in the context of its ACLs) in order to support printer driver
down- and uploads.  Don't fear -- this does not mean Windows 9x
clients are thrown aside now. They can use Samba's
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share support just fine.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2917566"></a>Creating the [print$] Share</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
In order to support the up- and downloading of printer driver files,
you must first configure a file share named
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>. The &quot;public&quot; name of this share is
hard coded in Samba's internals (because it is hard coded in the MS
Windows clients too). It cannot be renamed since Windows clients are
programmed to search for a service of exactly this name if they want
to retrieve printer driver files.
</p><p>
You should modify the server's  file to
add the global parameters and create the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> file share (of course, some of the
parameter values, such as 'path' are arbitrary and should be replaced
with appropriate values for your site):
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2917613"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 18.3. [print\$] example</b></p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td># members of the ntadmin group should be able to add drivers and set</td></tr><tr><td># printer properties. root is implicitly always a 'printer admin'.</td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin = @ntadmin</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td>...</td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td>...</td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>comment = Printer Driver Download Area</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>path = /etc/samba/drivers</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>browseable = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>read only = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>write list = @ntadmin, root</tt></i></td></tr></table></div><p>
Of course, you also need to ensure that the directory named by the

In order for a Windows NT print server to support the downloading of
driver files by multiple client architectures, you must create several
subdirectories within the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> service
(i.e. the UNIX directory named by the <a class="indexterm" name="id2918085"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>path</tt></i>

architectures. Samba follows this model as well. Just like the name of
the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share itself, the subdirectories
*must* be exactly the names listed below (you may leave out the
subdirectories of architectures you don't want to support).
</p><p>
Therefore, create a directory tree below the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share for each architecture you wish
to support.

In order to add a new driver to your Samba host, one of two conditions
must hold true:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The account used to connect to the Samba host must

Of course, the connected account must still possess access to add
files to the subdirectories beneath
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>. Remember that all file shares are set
to 'read only' by default.
</p></div><p>
Once you have created the required <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
service and associated subdirectories, go to a Windows NT 4.0/2k/XP
client workstation. Open <span class="guiicon">Network Neighbourhood</span> or 
<span class="guiicon">My Network Places</span> and browse for the Samba host.
Once you have located the server, navigate to its <span class="guiicon">Printers and

You have successfully created the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share in ?  And Samba has re-read its
configuration? Good. But you are not yet ready to take off. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>driver files</em></span> need to be present in this share,

<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>using the Samba commandline utility
<b class="command">rpcclient</b> with its various subcommands (here:
<b class="command">adddriver</b> and <b class="command">setdriver</b>) from
any UNIX workstation;</p></li><li><p>running a GUI (<span class="emphasis"><em>Printer
Properties</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Printer Wizard</em></span>)
from any Windows NT/2k/XP client workstation.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The latter option is probably the easier one (even if the only
entrance to this realm seems a little bit weird at first).
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2918333"></a>Setting Drivers for existing Printers with a Client GUI</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The initial listing of printers in the Samba host's
<span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder accessed from a client's Explorer
will have no real printer driver assigned to them. By default
this driver name is set to a NULL
string. This must be changed now. The local <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Printer
Wizard</em></span>, run from NT/2000/XP clients, will help us in this
task.
</p><p>
However, the job to set a valid driver for the printer is not a
straightforward one: You must attempt to view the printer properties
for the printer to which you want the driver assigned. Open the
Windows Explorer, open Network Neighbourhood, browse to the Samba
host, open Samba's <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder, right-click the printer icon and
select <span class="guimenu">Properties...</span>. You are now trying to view printer and driver
properties for a queue which has this default <tt class="constant">NULL</tt> driver
assigned. This will result in an error message (this is normal here):
</p><p><span class="errorname"> Device settings cannot be displayed. The driver
for the specified printer is not installed, only spooler properties
will be displayed. Do you want to install the driver
now?</span></p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span>Don't click <span class="guibutton">Yes</span>!  Instead,
<span class="emphasis"><em>click <span class="guibutton">No</span></em></span> in the error dialog.
Only now you will be presented with the printer properties window. From here,
the way to assign a driver to a printer is open to us. You have now the choice
either:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>select a driver from the pop-up list of installed
drivers.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Initially this list will be empty.</em></span>
Or</p></li><li><p>use the <span class="guibutton">New Driver...</span> button to
install a new printer driver (which will in fact start up the
APW).</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the APW is started, the procedure is exactly the same as the one
you are familiar with in Windows (we assume here that you are
familiar with the printer driver installations procedure on Windows
NT). Make sure your connection is in fact setup as a user with
<a class="indexterm" name="id2918468"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> privileges (if in doubt, use
<b class="command">smbstatus</b> to check for this). If you wish to
install printer drivers for client operating systems other than
<span class="application">Windows NT x86</span>, you will need to use the
<span class="guilabel">Sharing</span> tab of the printer properties dialog.
</p><p>
Assuming you have connected with an administrative (or root) account
(as named by the <a class="indexterm" name="id2918510"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> parameter),
you will also be able to modify other printer properties such as ACLs
and default device settings using this dialog. For the default device
settings, please consider the advice given further below.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2918531"></a>Setting Drivers for existing Printers with
<b class="command">rpcclient</b></h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The second way to install printer drivers into
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> and set them up in a valid way can be
done from the UNIX command line.  This involves four distinct steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>gathering the info about the required driver files
and collecting the files together;</p></li><li><p>deposit the driver files into the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share's correct subdirectories
(possibly by using <b class="command">smbclient</b>);</p></li><li><p>running the <b class="command">rpcclient</b>
commandline utility once with the <b class="command">adddriver</b>
subcommand,</p></li><li><p>running <b class="command">rpcclient</b> a second
time with the <b class="command">setdriver</b>
subcommand.</p></li></ol></div><p>
We will provide detailed hints for each of these steps in the next few
paragraphs.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2918640"></a>Identifying the Driver Files</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
To find out about the driver files, you have two options: you could
investigate the driver CD which comes with your printer.  Study the
<tt class="filename">*.inf</tt> file on the CD, if it is contained. This
may not be the possible, since the *.inf file might be
missing. Unfortunately, many vendors have now started to use their own
installation programs. These installations packages are often some
sort of Windows platform archive format, plus, the files may get
re-named during the installation process. This makes it extremely
difficult to identify the driver files you need.
</p><p>
Then you only have the second option: install the driver first on a
Windows client *locally* and investigate which file names and paths it
uses after they are installed. (Note, that you need to repeat this
procedure for every client platform you want to support. We are going
to show it here for the <span class="application">W32X86</span> platform only, a
name used by Microsoft for all WinNT/2k/XP clients...)
</p><p>
A good method to recognize the driver files this is to print the test
page from the driver's <span class="guilabel">Properties</span> Dialog
(<span class="guilabel">General</span> tab). Then look at the list of driver
files named on the printout. You'll need to recognize what Windows
(and Samba) are calling the <span class="guilabel">Driver File</span> , the
<span class="guilabel">Data File</span>, the <span class="guilabel">Config File</span>,
the <span class="guilabel">Help File</span> and (optionally) the
<span class="guilabel">Dependent Driver Files</span> (this may vary slightly
for Windows NT).  You need to remember all names (or better take a
note) for the next steps.
</p><p>
Another method to quickly test the driver filenames and related paths
is provided by the <b class="command">rpcclient</b> utility. Run it with
<b class="command">enumdrivers</b> or with the
<b class="command">getdriver</b> subcommand, each in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span> level. In the following example,
<span class="emphasis"><em>TURBO_XP</em></span> is the name of the Windows PC (in this
case it was a Windows XP Professional laptop, BTW). I had installed
the driver locally to TURBO_XP while <span class="emphasis"><em>kde-bitshop</em></span> is
the name of the Linux host from which I am working. We could run an
<span class="emphasis"><em>interactive</em></span> <b class="command">rpcclient</b> session;
then we'd get an <span class="emphasis"><em>rpcclient /&gt;</em></span> prompt and would
type the subcommands at this prompt. This is left as a good exercise
to the reader. For now we use <b class="command">rpcclient</b> with the
<tt class="option">-c</tt> parameter to execute a single subcommand
line and exit again. This is the method you would use if you want to
create scripts to automate the procedure for a large number of
printers and drivers. Note the different quotes used to overcome the
different spaces in between words:

You may notice, that this driver has quite a big number of
<span class="guilabel">Dependentfiles</span> (I know worse cases however). Also,
strangely, the <span class="guilabel">Driver File</span> is here tagged as
<span class="guilabel">Driver Path</span>.... oh, well. Here we don't have yet
support for the so-called <span class="application">WIN40</span> architecture
installed. This name is used by Microsoft for the Win95/98/ME platforms.
If we want to support these, we need to install the Win95/98/ME driver
files in addition to those for <span class="application">W32X86</span>
(i.e. the WinNT72000/XP clients) onto a Windows PC. This PC
can also host the Win9x drivers, even if itself runs on Windows NT,
2000 or XP.
</p><p>
Since the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share is usually accessible
through the <span class="guiicon">Network Neighbourhood</span>, you can also use the UNC notation
from Windows Explorer to poke at it. The Win9x driver files will end
up in subdirectory &quot;0&quot; of the &quot;WIN40&quot; directory. The full path to
access them will be
<tt class="filename">\\WINDOWSHOST\print$\WIN40\0\</tt>.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> more recent drivers on Windows 2000 and Windows XP are
installed into the &quot;3&quot; subdirectory instead of the &quot;2&quot;. The version 2
of drivers, as used in Windows NT, were running in Kernel Mode.
Windows 2000 changed this. While it still can use the Kernel Mode
drivers (if this is enabled by the Admin), its native mode for printer
drivers is User Mode execution. This requires drivers designed for
this. These type of drivers install into the &quot;3&quot; subdirectory.

Now we need to collect all the driver files we identified. in our
previous step. Where do we get them from? Well, why not retrieve them
from the very PC and the same <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share
which we investigated in our last step to identify the files? We can
use <b class="command">smbclient</b> to do this. We will use the paths and

After this command is complete, the files are in our current local
directory. You probably have noticed that this time we passed several
commands to the <tt class="option">-c</tt> parameter, separated by semi-colons.  This
effects that all commands are executed in sequence on the remote
Windows server before smbclient exits again.
</p><p>
Don't forget to repeat the procedure for the <span class="application">WIN40</span>
architecture should you need to support Win95/98/XP clients.  Remember, the
files for these architectures are in the WIN40/0/ subdir. Once we are
complete, we can run <b class="command">smbclient ...  put</b> to store
the collected files on the Samba server's
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share.

So, now we are going to put the driver files into the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share. Remember, the UNIX path to this
share has been defined previously in your
. You also have created subdirectories
for the different Windows client types you want to support. Supposing
your <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share maps to the UNIX path
<tt class="filename">/etc/samba/drivers/</tt>, your driver files should now
go here:

We again use smbclient to transfer the driver files across the
network. We specify the same files and paths as were leaked to us by
running <b class="command">getdriver</b> against the original

Phewww -- that was a lot of typing! Most drivers are a lot smaller --
many only having 3 generic PostScript driver files plus 1 PPD. Note,
that while we did retrieve the files from the &quot;2&quot; subdirectory of the
&quot;W32X86&quot; directory from the Windows box, we <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span>
put them (for now) in this same subdirectory of the Samba box! This

Notice that there are already driver files present in the
<tt class="filename">2</tt> subdir (probably from a previous
installation). Once the files for the new driver are there too, you
are still a few steps away from being able to use them on the
clients. The only thing you could do *now* is to retrieve them from a
client just like you retrieve ordinary files from a file share, by
opening print$ in Windows Explorer. But that wouldn't install them per
Point'n'Print. The reason is: Samba doesn't know yet that these files
are something special, namely <span class="emphasis"><em>printer driver
files</em></span> and it doesn't know yet to which print queue(s) these
driver files belong.

So, next you must tell Samba about the special category of the files
you just uploaded into the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share. This
is done by the <b class="command">adddriver</b> command. It will
prompt Samba to register the driver files into its internal TDB

After this step the driver should be recognized by Samba on the print
server. You need to be very careful when typing the command. Don't
exchange the order of the fields. Some changes would lead to a
<tt class="computeroutput">NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</tt> error
message. These become obvious. Other changes might install the driver
files successfully, but render the driver unworkable. So take care!
Hints about the syntax of the adddriver command are in the man
page. The CUPS printing chapter of this HOWTO collection provides a
more detailed description, if you should need it.

Another verification is that the timestamp of the printing TDB files
is now updated (and possibly their filesize has increased).

Now the driver should be registered with Samba. We can easily verify
this, and will do so in a moment. However, this driver is
<span class="emphasis"><em>not yet</em></span> associated with a particular
<span class="emphasis"><em>printer</em></span>. We may check the driver status of the
files by at least three methods:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>from any Windows client browse Network Neighbourhood,
find the Samba host and open the Samba <span class="guiicon">Printers and
Faxes</span> folder. Select any printer icon, right-click and
select the printer <span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span>. Click on the
<span class="guilabel">Advanced</span> tab. Here is a field indicating the
driver for that printer. A drop down menu allows you to change that
driver (be careful to not do this unwittingly.).  You can use this
list to view all drivers know to Samba. Your new one should be amongst
them. (Each type of client will only see his own architecture's
list. If you don't have every driver installed for each platform, the
list will differ if you look at it from Windows95/98/ME or
WindowsNT/2000/XP.)</p></li><li><p>from a Windows 2000 or XP client (not WinNT) browse
<span class="guiicon">Network Neighbourhood</span>, search for the Samba
server and open the server's <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder,
right-click the white background (with no printer highlighted). Select
<span class="guimenuitem">Server Properties</span>. On the
<span class="guilabel">Drivers</span> tab you will see the new driver listed
now. This view enables you to also inspect the list of files belonging
to that driver<span class="emphasis"><em> (this doesn't work on Windows NT, but only on
Windows 2000 and Windows XP. WinNT doesn't provide the &quot;Drivers&quot;
tab).</em></span>. An alternative, much quicker method for Windows
2000/XP to start this dialog is by typing into a DOS box (you must of
course adapt the name to your Samba server instead of <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i>):
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt> rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /s /t2 /n\\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i></tt></b></p></li><li><p>from a UNIX prompt run this command (or a variant
thereof), where <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i> is the name of the Samba

</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient -U'root%xxxx' -c 'enumdrivers' <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i></tt></b></p><p>
You will see a listing of all drivers Samba knows about. Your new one
should be amongst them. But it is only listed under the <i class="parameter"><tt>[Windows NT
x86]</tt></i> heading, not under <i class="parameter"><tt>[Windows 4.0]</tt></i>,
since we didn't install that part. Or did *you*? -- You will see a listing of
all drivers Samba knows about. Your new one should be amongst them. In our
example it is named <span class="emphasis"><em>dm9110</em></span>.  Note that the 3rd column
shows the other installed drivers twice, for each supported architecture one
time. Our new driver only shows up for 
<span class="application">Windows NT 4.0 or 2000</span>. To
have it present for <span class="application">Windows 95, 98 and ME</span> you'll
have to repeat the whole procedure with the WIN40 architecture and subdirectory.

You will also be able to bind that driver to any print queue (however,
you are responsible yourself that you associate drivers to queues
which make sense to the target printer). Note, that you can't run the
<b class="command">rpcclient</b> <b class="command">adddriver</b> command
repeatedly. Each run &quot;consumes&quot; the files you had put into the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share by moving them into the
respective subdirectories. So you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> precede an
<b class="command">smbclient ... put</b> command before each

Samba still needs to know <span class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> printer's driver
this is.  It needs to create a mapping of the driver to a printer, and
store this info in its &quot;memory&quot;, the TDB files. The <b class="command">rpcclient

the <b class="command">setdriver</b> command will only succeed if the printer is

A famous philosopher said once: &#8220;<span class="quote">The Proof of the Pudding lies
in the Eating</span>&#8221;. The proof for our setup lies in the printing.
So let's install the printer driver onto the client PCs. This is not
as straightforward as it may seem. Read on.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2920260"></a>The first Client Driver Installation</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Especially important is the installation onto the first client PC (for
each architectural platform separately). Once this is done correctly,
all further clients are easy to setup and shouldn't need further
attention. What follows is a description for the recommended first
procedure. You work now from a client workstation. First you should
guarantee that your connection is not unwittingly mapped to
<span class="emphasis"><em>bad user</em></span> &quot;nobody&quot;. In a DOS box type:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>net use \\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-SERVER</tt></i>\print$ /user:root</tt></b></p><p>
Replace root, if needed, by another valid 
<i class="replaceable"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> user as given in the  definition.
Should you already be connected as a different user, you'll get an error
message. There is no easy way to get rid of that connection, because
Windows doesn't seem to know a concept of &quot;logging off&quot; from a share
connection (don't confuse this with logging off from the local
workstation; that is a different matter). You can try to close
<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> Windows file explorer and Internet Explorer
windows. As a last resort, you may have to reboot. Make sure there is
no automatic re-connection set up. It may be easier to go to a
different workstation and try from there. After you have made sure you
are connected as a printer admin user (you can check this with the
<b class="command">smbstatus</b> command on Samba) do this from the
Windows workstation:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Open <span class="guiicon">Network
Neighbourhood</span></p></li><li><p>Browse to Samba server</p></li><li><p>Open its <span class="guiicon">Printers and
Faxes</span> folder</p></li><li><p>Highlight and right-click the printer</p></li><li><p>Select <span class="guimenuitem">Connect...</span> (for WinNT4/2K
it is possibly <span class="guimenuitem">Install...</span>)</p></li></ul></div><p>
A new printer (named <i class="replaceable"><tt>printername</tt></i> on
samba-server) should now have appeared in your
<span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> Printer folder (check <span class="guimenu">Start</span> --
<span class="guimenuitem">Settings</span> -- <span class="guimenuitem">Control Panel</span>
-- <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span>).
</p><p>
Most likely you are now tempted to try and print a test page.  After
all, you now can open the printer properties and on the &quot;General&quot; tab,
there is a button offering to do just that. But chances are that you
get an error message saying <span class="errorname">Unable to print Test
Page</span>. The reason might be that there is not yet a
valid Device Mode set for the driver, or that the &quot;Printer Driver
Data&quot; set is still incomplete.
</p><p>
You must now make sure that a valid &quot;Device Mode&quot; is set for the
driver. Don't fear -- we will explain now what that means.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2920462"></a>IMPORTANT! Setting Device Modes on new Printers</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
In order for a printer to be truly usable by a Windows NT/2K/XP
client, it must possess:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a valid <span class="emphasis"><em>Device Mode</em></span> generated by
the driver for the printer (defining things like paper size,
orientation and duplex settings), and</p></li><li><p>a complete set of
<span class="emphasis"><em>Printer Driver Data</em></span> generated by the
driver.</p></li></ul></div><p>
If either one of these is incomplete, the clients can produce less
than optimal output at best. In the worst cases, unreadable garbage or
nothing at all comes from the printer or they produce a harvest of
error messages when attempting to print. Samba stores the named values
and all printing related info in its internal TDB database files
<tt class="filename">(ntprinters.tdb</tt>,
<tt class="filename">ntdrivers.tdb</tt>, <tt class="filename">printing.tdb</tt>
and <tt class="filename">ntforms.tdb</tt>).
</p><p>
What do these two words stand for? Basically, the Device Mode and the
set of Printer Driver Data is a collection of settings for all print
queue properties, initialized in a sensible way. Device Modes and
Printer Driver Data should initially be set on the print server (that is
here: the Samba host) to healthy values so that the clients can start
to use them immediately. How do we set these initial healthy values?
This can be achieved by accessing the drivers remotely from an NT (or
2k/XP) client, as is discussed in the next paragraphs.
</p><p>
Be aware, that a valid Device Mode can only be initiated by a
<a class="indexterm" name="id2920558"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>, or root (the reason should be
obvious). Device Modes can only correctly be set by executing the
printer driver program itself. Since Samba can not execute this Win32
platform driver code, it sets this field initially to NULL (which is
not a valid setting for clients to use). Fortunately, most drivers
generate themselves the Printer Driver Data that is needed, when they
are uploaded to the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share with the
help of the APW or rpcclient.
</p><p>
The generation and setting of a first valid Device Mode however
requires some &quot;tickling&quot; from a client, to set it on the Samba
server. The easiest means of doing so is to simply change the page
orientation on the server's printer. This &quot;executes&quot; enough of the
printer driver program on the client for the desired effect to happen,
and feeds back the new Device Mode to our Samba server. You can use the
native Windows NT/2K/XP printer properties page from a Window client

This procedure has executed the printer driver program on the client
platform and fed back the correct Device Mode to Samba, which now
stored it in its TDB files. Once the driver is installed on the
client, you can follow the analogous steps by accessing the
<span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> <span class="guiicon">Printers</span> folder too if you are
a Samba printer admin user. From now on printing should work as expected.
</p><p>
Samba also includes a service level parameter name <i class="parameter"><tt>default
devmode</tt></i> for generating a default Device Mode for a
printer. Some drivers will function well with Samba's default set of
properties. Others may crash the client's spooler service. So use this
parameter with caution. It is always better to have the client
generate a valid device mode for the printer and store it on the
server for you.

Every further driver may be done by any user, along the lines
described above: Browse network, open printers folder on Samba server,
right-click printer and choose <span class="guimenuitem">Connect...</span>. Once
this completes (should be not more than a few seconds, but could also take
a minute, depending on network conditions), you should find the new printer in
your client workstation local <span class="guiicon">Printers and
Faxes</span> folder.
</p><p>
You can also open your local <span class="guiicon">Printers and Faxes</span> folder by
using this command on Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional workstations:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 shell32.dll,SHHelpShortcuts_RunDLL PrintersFolder
</tt></b></p><p>
or this command on Windows NT 4.0 workstations:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>
rundll32 shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL MAIN.CPL @2
</tt></b></p><p>
You can enter the commands either inside a <span class="guilabel">DOS box</span> window 
or in the <span class="guimenuitem">Run command...</span> field from the 
<span class="guimenu">Start</span> menu.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2920857"></a>Always make first Client Connection as root or &quot;printer admin&quot;</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
After you installed the driver on the Samba server (in its
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share, you should always make sure
that your first client installation completes correctly. Make it a habit for
yourself to build that the very first connection from a client as
<a class="indexterm" name="id2920879"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>. This is to make sure that:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p> a first valid <span class="emphasis"><em>Device Mode</em></span> is
really initialized (see above for more explanation details), and
that</p></li><li><p> the default print settings of your printer for all
further client installations are as you want them</p></li></ul></div><p>
Do this by changing the orientation to landscape, click
<span class="emphasis"><em>Apply</em></span>, and then change it back again. Then modify
the other settings (for example, you don't want the default media size
set to <span class="emphasis"><em>Letter</em></span>, when you are all using
<span class="emphasis"><em>A4</em></span>, right? You may want to set the printer for
<span class="emphasis"><em>duplex</em></span> as the default; etc.).
</p><p>
To connect as root to a Samba printer, try this command from a Windows
2K/XP DOS box command prompt:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">C:\&gt; </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>runas /netonly /user:root &quot;rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /p /t3 /n 
	\\<i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-SERVER</tt></i>\<i class="replaceable"><tt>printername</tt></i>&quot;</tt></b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
You will be prompted for root's Samba-password; type it, wait a few
seconds, click on <span class="guibutton">Printing Defaults...</span> and
proceed to set the job options as should be used as defaults by all
clients. Alternatively, instead of root you can name one other member
of the <a class="indexterm" name="id2921000"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> from the setting.
</p><p>
Now all the other users downloading and installing the driver
the same way (called <span class="emphasis"><em>Point'n'Print</em></span>) will
have the same defaults set for them. If you miss this step you'll
get a lot of helpdesk calls from your users. But maybe you like to
talk to people.... ;-)

Your driver is installed. It is ready for

now. You <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> have tried to download and use it
onto your first client machine now. But wait... let's make you
acquainted first with a few tips and tricks you may find useful.  For
example, suppose you didn't manage to &quot;set the defaults&quot; on the
printer, as advised in the preceding paragraphs? And your users
complain about various issues (such as &#8220;<span class="quote">We need to set the paper
size for each job from Letter to A4 and it won't store it!</span>&#8221;)

The last sentence might be viewed with mixed feelings by some users and
admins. They have struggled for hours and hours and couldn't arrive at
a point were their settings seemed to be saved.  It is not their
fault. The confusing thing is this: in the multi-tabbed dialog that pops
up when you right-click the printer name and select 
<span class="guimenuitem">Properties...</span>, you can arrive at two identically
looking dialogs, each claiming that they help you to set printer options,
in three different ways. Here is the definite answer to the &quot;Samba
Default Driver Setting FAQ&quot;:
</p><p><b>&#8220;<span class="quote">I can't set and save default print options
for all users on Win2K/XP! Why not?</span>&#8221; </b>
How are you doing it? I bet the wrong way.... (it is not very
easy to find out, though). There are 3 different ways to bring you to
a dialog that <span class="emphasis"><em>seems</em></span> to set everything. All three
dialogs <span class="emphasis"><em>look</em></span> the same. Only one of them
<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> what you intend.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Important:</em></span> you need to be Administrator or Print
Administrator to do this for all users. Here is how I reproduce it in
on XP Professional:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="A"><li><p>The first &quot;wrong&quot; way:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="guiicon">Printers</span>
folder.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the printer
(<span class="emphasis"><em>remoteprinter on cupshost</em></span>) and
select in context menu <span class="guimenu">Printing
Preferences...</span></p></li><li><p>Look at this dialog closely and remember what it looks
like.</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>The second &quot;wrong&quot; way:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Open the <span class="guimenu">Printers</span>
folder.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the printer (<span class="emphasis"><em>remoteprinter on
cupshost</em></span>) and select in the context menu
<span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span></p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">General</span>
tab</p></li><li><p>Click on the button <span class="guibutton">Printing
Preferences...</span></p></li><li><p>A new dialog opens. Keep this dialog open and go back
to the parent dialog.</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></li><li><p>The third, the &quot;correct&quot; way: (should you do
this from the beginning, just carry out steps 1. and 2. from second
&quot;way&quot; above)

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Click on the <span class="guilabel">Advanced</span>
tab. (Hmmm... if everything is &quot;Grayed Out&quot;, then you are not logged
in as a user with enough privileges).</p></li><li><p>Click on the <span class="guibutton">Printing
Defaults...</span> button.</p></li><li><p>On any of the two new tabs, click on the
<span class="guilabel">Advanced...</span> button.</p></li><li><p>A new dialog opens. Compare this one to the other,
identical looking one from &quot;B.5&quot; or A.3&quot;.</p></li></ol></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>

Do you see any difference in the two settings dialogs? I don't
either. However, only the last one, which you arrived at with steps
C.1.-6. will permanently save any settings which will then become the
defaults for new users. If you want all clients to have the same
defaults, you need to conduct these steps as administrator
(<a class="indexterm" name="id2921360"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> in )
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> a client downloads the driver (the clients
can later set their own <span class="emphasis"><em>per-user defaults</em></span> by
following the procedures <span class="emphasis"><em>A.</em></span>
or <span class="emphasis"><em>B.</em></span> above...). (This is new: Windows 2000 and
Windows XP allow <span class="emphasis"><em>per-user</em></span> default settings and
the ones the administrator gives them, before they set up their own).
The &quot;parents&quot; of the identically looking dialogs have a slight
difference in their window names: one is called
<tt class="computeroutput">Default Print Values for Printer Foo on Server
Bar&quot;</tt> (which is the one you need) and the other is
called &quot;<tt class="computeroutput">Print Settings for Printer Foo on Server
Bar</tt>&quot;. The last one is the one you arrive at when you
right-click on the printer and select <span class="guimenuitem">Print
Settings...</span>. This is the one what you were
taught to use back in the days of Windows NT! So it is only natural to
try the same way with Win2k or WinXP. You wouldn't dream
that there is now a different &quot;clicking path&quot; to arrive at an
identically looking, but functionally different dialog to set defaults
for all users!

One issue that has arisen during the recent development phase of Samba
is the need to support driver downloads for 100's of printers. Using
Windows NT APW here is somewhat awkward (to say the least). If you
don't want to acquire RSS pains from such the printer installation
clicking orgy alone, you need to think about a non-interactive script.
</p><p>
If more than one printer is using the same driver, the
<b class="command">rpcclient setdriver</b> command can be used to set the
driver associated with an installed queue. If the driver is uploaded
to <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> once and registered with the
printing TDBs, it can be used by multiple print queues. In this case
you just need to repeat the <b class="command">setprinter</b> subcommand
of <b class="command">rpcclient</b> for every queue (without the need to
conduct the <b class="command">adddriver</b> again and again). The
following is an example of how this could be accomplished:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient <i class="replaceable"><tt>SAMBA-CUPS</tt></i> -U root%<i class="replaceable"><tt>secret</tt></i> -c 'enumdrivers'</tt></b>

It may be not easy to recognize: but the first call to
<b class="command">enumprinters</b> showed the &quot;dm9110&quot; printer with an
empty string where the driver should have been listed (between the 2
commas in the &quot;description&quot; field). After the
<b class="command">setdriver</b> command succeeded, all is well.  (The
CUPS Printing chapter has more info about the installation of printer
drivers with the help of <b class="command">rpcclient</b>).

By default, Samba exhibits all printer shares defined in
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> in the
<span class="guiicon">Printers...</span> folder. Also located in this folder
is the Windows NT Add Printer Wizard icon. The APW will be shown only
if:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>...the connected user is able to successfully execute
an <b class="command">OpenPrinterEx(\\server)</b> with administrative
privileges (i.e. root or <a class="indexterm" name="id2921887"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>).
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p> Try this from a Windows 2K/XP DOS box command prompt:

<a class="indexterm" name="id2921942"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>show add printer wizard</tt></i> = yes (the

The APW can do various things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>upload a new driver to the Samba
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share;</p></li><li><p>associate an uploaded driver with an existing (but
still &quot;driverless&quot;) print queue;</p></li><li><p>exchange the currently used driver for an existing
print queue with one that has been uploaded before;</p></li><li><p>add an entirely new printer to the Samba host (only in
conjunction with a working <a class="indexterm" name="id2922001"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>add printer command</tt></i>;
a corresponding <a class="indexterm" name="id2922017"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>delete printer command</tt></i> for
removing entries from the <span class="guiicon">Printers...</span> folder
may be provided too)</p></li></ul></div><p>
The last one (add a new printer) requires more effort than the
previous ones. In order to use the APW to successfully add a printer
to a Samba server, the <a class="indexterm" name="id2922045"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>add printer command</tt></i> must
have a defined value. The program hook must successfully add the
printer to the UNIX print system (i.e. to
<tt class="filename">/etc/printcap</tt>,
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/printers.conf</tt> or other appropriate
files) and to  if necessary.
</p><p>
When using the APW from a client, if the named printer share does not
exist, smbd will execute the <i class="parameter"><tt>add printer
command</tt></i> and reparse to the 
to attempt to locate the new printer share. If the share is still not
defined, an error of <span class="errorname">Access Denied</span> is
returned to the client.  Note that the <a class="indexterm" name="id2922095"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>add printer command</tt></i> is executed under the context of the connected
user, not necessarily a root account. A <a class="indexterm" name="id2922111"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>map to guest</tt></i> = bad user may have connected you unwittingly under the wrong
privilege; you should check it by using the
<b class="command">smbstatus</b> command.

Once you are connected with the wrong credentials, there is no means
to reverse the situation other than to close all Explorer windows, and
perhaps reboot.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The <b class="command">net use \\SAMBA-SERVER\sharename
/user:root</b> gives you an error message: <tt class="computeroutput">Multiple

Disconnect first any existing connection to this network share in

So you close all connections. You try again. You get the same
message. You check from the Samba side, using
<b class="command">smbstatus</b>. Yes, there are some more
connections. You kill them all. The client still gives you the same
error message. You watch the smbd.log file on a very high debug level
and try re-connect. Same error message, but not a single line in the
log. You start to wonder if there was a connection attempt at all. You
run ethereal and tcpdump while you try to connect. Result: not a
single byte goes on the wire. Windows still gives the error
message. You close all Explorer Windows and start it again. You try to
connect - and this times it works!  Windows seems to cache connection
info somewhere and doesn't keep it up to date (if you are unlucky you
might need to reboot to get rid of the error message).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2922236"></a>Be careful when assembling Driver Files</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
You need to be very careful when you take notes about the files and
belonging to a particular driver. Don't confuse the files for driver
version &quot;0&quot; (for Win95/98/ME, going into
<tt class="filename">[print$]/WIN/0/</tt>), driver version &quot;2&quot; (Kernel Mode
driver for WinNT, going into <tt class="filename">[print$]/W32X86/2/</tt>
<span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be used on Win2K/XP too), and driver version
&quot;3&quot; (non-Kernel Mode driver going into
<tt class="filename">[print$]/W32X86/3/</tt> <span class="emphasis"><em>can not</em></span>
be used on WinNT). Very often these different driver versions contain
files carrying the same name; but still the files are very different!
Also, if you look at them from the Windows Explorer (they reside in
<tt class="filename">%WINDOWS%\system32\spool\drivers\W32X86\</tt>) you
will probably see names in capital letters, while an &quot;enumdrivers&quot;
command from Samba would show mixed or lower case letters. So it is
easy to confuse them. If you install them manually using
<b class="command">rpcclient</b> and subcommands, you may even succeed
without an error message. Only later, when you try install on a
client, you will encounter error messages like <tt class="computeroutput">This
server has no appropriate driver for the printer</tt>.
</p><p>
Here is an example. You are invited to look very closely at the
various files, compare their names and their spelling, and discover
the differences in the composition of the version-2 and -3 sets
Note: the version-0 set contained 40 (!)
<i class="parameter"><tt>Dependentfiles</tt></i>, so I left it out for space
reasons:

In my example were even more differences than shown here.  Conclusion:
you must be very careful to select the correct driver files for each
driver version. Don't rely on the names alone. Don't interchange files
belonging to different driver versions.

Windows NT/2000 print servers associate a port with each
printer. These normally take the form of <tt class="filename">LPT1:</tt>,
<tt class="filename">COM1:</tt>, <tt class="filename">FILE:</tt>, etc. Samba
must also support the concept of ports associated with a printer. By
default, only one printer port, named &quot;Samba Printer Port&quot;, exists on
a system. Samba does not really need such a &quot;port&quot; in order to print;
it rather is a requirement of Windows clients.  They insist on being
told about an available port when they request this info, otherwise
they throw an error message at you. So Samba fakes the port
information to keep the Windows clients happy.
</p><p>
Note that Samba does not support the concept of &quot;Printer Pooling&quot;
internally either. Printer Pooling assigns a logical printer to
multiple ports as a form of load balancing or fail over.
</p><p>
If you require that multiple ports be defined for some reason or
another (&#8220;<span class="quote">My users and my Boss should not know that they are
working with Samba</span>&#8221;),  possesses a
<a class="indexterm" name="id2922668"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>enumports command</tt></i> which can be used to define
an external program that generates a listing of ports on a system.

So - printing works, but there are still problems. Most jobs print
well, some don't print at all. Some jobs have problems with fonts,
which don't look good at all. Some jobs print fast, and some are
dead-slow. We can't cover it all; but we want to encourage you to read
the little paragraph about &quot;Avoiding the wrong PostScript Driver

</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2922712"></a>The Imprints Toolset</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The Imprints tool set provides a UNIX equivalent of the
Windows NT Add Printer Wizard. For complete information, please
refer to the Imprints web site
at <a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://imprints.sourceforge.net/</a>
as well as the documentation included with the imprints source
distribution. This section will only provide a brief introduction
to the features of Imprints.
</p><p><b>Attention! Maintainer required. </b>
Unfortunately, the Imprints toolset is no longer maintained. As of
December, 2000, the project is in need of a new maintainer. The most
important skill to have is decent perl coding and an interest in
MS-RPC based printing using Samba. If you wish to volunteer, please
coordinate your efforts on the samba-technical mailing list. The
toolset is still in usable form; but only for a series of older
printer models, where there are prepared packages to use. Packages for
more up to date print devices are needed if Imprints should have a
future.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2922768"></a>What is Imprints?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Imprints is a collection of tools for supporting these goals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Providing a central repository information regarding
Windows NT and 95/98 printer driver packages</p></li><li><p>Providing the tools necessary for creating the
Imprints printer driver packages.</p></li><li><p>Providing an installation client which will obtain
printer drivers from a central internet (or intranet) Imprints Server
repository and install them on remote Samba and Windows NT4 print
servers.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2922810"></a>Creating Printer Driver Packages</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The process of creating printer driver packages is beyond the scope of
this document (refer to Imprints.txt also included with the Samba
distribution for more information). In short, an Imprints driver
package is a gzipped tarball containing the driver files, related INF
files, and a control file needed by the installation client.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2922828"></a>The Imprints Server</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The Imprints server is really a database server that may be queried
via standard HTTP mechanisms. Each printer entry in the database has
an associated URL for the actual downloading of the package. Each
package is digitally signed via GnuPG which can be used to verify that
package downloaded is actually the one referred in the Imprints
database. It is strongly recommended that this security check
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be disabled.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2922853"></a>The Installation Client</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
More information regarding the Imprints installation client is
available in the <tt class="filename">Imprints-Client-HOWTO.ps</tt> file
included with the imprints source package.
</p><p>
The Imprints installation client comes in two forms.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a set of command line Perl scripts</p></li><li><p>a GTK+ based graphical interface to the command line Perl
scripts</p></li></ul></div><p>
The installation client (in both forms) provides a means of querying
the Imprints database server for a matching list of known printer
model names as well as a means to download and install the drivers on
remote Samba and Windows NT print servers.
</p><p>
The basic installation process is in four steps and perl code is
wrapped around smbclient and rpcclient
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	foreach (supported architecture for a given driver) 
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>rpcclient: Get the appropriate upload directory on the remote server</p></li><li><p>smbclient: Upload the driver files</p></li><li><p>rpcclient: Issues an AddPrinterDriver() MS-RPC</p></li></ol></div><p>
	</p></li><li><p>rpcclient: Issue an AddPrinterEx() MS-RPC to actually create the printer</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of the problems encountered when implementing the Imprints tool
set was the name space issues between various supported client
architectures. For example, Windows NT includes a driver named &quot;Apple
LaserWriter II NTX v51.8&quot; and Windows 95 calls its version of this
driver &quot;Apple LaserWriter II NTX&quot;
</p><p>
The problem is how to know what client drivers have been uploaded for
a printer. An astute reader will remember that the Windows NT Printer
Properties dialog only includes space for one printer driver name. A
quick look in the Windows NT 4.0 system registry at
</p><p><tt class="filename">
 HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environment
</tt></p><p>
will reveal that Windows NT always uses the NT driver name.  This is
ok as Windows NT always requires that at least the Windows NT version
of the printer driver is present. However, Samba does not have the
requirement internally. Therefore, how can you use the NT driver name
if is has not already been installed?
</p><p>
The way of sidestepping this limitation is to require that all
Imprints printer driver packages include both the Intel Windows NT and
95/98 printer drivers and that NT driver is installed first.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2923008"></a>Add Network Printers at Logon without User Interaction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The following MS Knowledge Base article may be of some help if you
need to handle Windows 2000 clients: <span class="emphasis"><em>How to Add Printers
with No User Interaction in Windows 2000.</em></span> ( <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;189105" target="_top">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;189105</a>
). It also applies to Windows XP Professional clients.
</p><p>
The ideas sketched out below are inspired by this article. It
describes a commandline method which can be applied to install
network and local printers and their drivers. This is most useful
if integrated in Logon Scripts. You can see what options are
available by typing in a command prompt (&quot;DOS box&quot;) this:
</p><p><b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /?</tt></b></p><p>
A window pops up which shows you all of the commandline switches
available. An extensive list of examples is also provided.  This is
only for Win 2k/XP. It doesn't work on WinNT. WinNT has probably some
other tools in the respective Resource Kit. Here is a suggestion about
what a client logon script might contain, with a short explanation of
what the lines actually do (it works if 2k/XP Windows clients access
printers via Samba, but works for Windows-based print servers too):
</p><pre class="screen">
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /dn /n &quot;\\sambacupsserver\infotec2105-IPDS&quot; /q</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /in /n &quot;\\sambacupsserver\infotec2105-PS&quot;</tt></b>
<b class="userinput"><tt>rundll32 printui.dll,PrintUIEntry /y /n &quot;\\sambacupsserver\infotec2105-PS&quot;</tt></b>
</pre><p>
Here is a list of the used commandline parameters: 
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">/dn</span></dt><dd><p>deletes a network printer</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/q</span></dt><dd><p>quiet modus</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/n</span></dt><dd><p>names a printer</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/in</span></dt><dd><p>adds a network printer connection</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/y</span></dt><dd><p>sets printer as default printer</p></dd></dl></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Line 1 deletes a possibly existing previous network
printer <span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-IPDS</em></span> (which had used native
Windows drivers with LPRng that were removed from the server which was
converted to CUPS). The <b class="command">/q</b> at the end eliminates
&quot;Confirm&quot; or error dialog boxes popping up. They should not be
presented to the user logging on.</p></li><li><p>Line 2 adds the new printer
<span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-PS</em></span> (which actually is same physical
device but is now run by the new CUPS printing system and associated
with the CUPS/Adobe PS drivers). The printer and its driver
<span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> have been added to Samba prior to the user
logging in (e.g. by a procedure as discussed earlier in this chapter,
or by running <b class="command">cupsaddsmb</b>). The driver is now
auto-downloaded to the client PC where the user is about to log
in.</p></li><li><p>Line 3 sets the default printer to this new network
printer (there might be several other printers installed with this
same method and some may be local as well -- so we decide for a
default printer). The default printer selection may of course be
different for different users.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that the second line only works if the printer
<span class="emphasis"><em>infotec2105-PS</em></span> has an already working print queue
on &quot;sambacupsserver&quot;, and if the printer drivers have successfully been
uploaded (via <b class="command">APW</b> ,
<b class="command">smbclient/rpcclient</b> or
<b class="command">cupsaddsmb</b>) into the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> driver repository of Samba. Also, some
Samba versions prior to version 3.0 required a re-start of smbd after
the printer install and the driver upload, otherwise the script (or
any other client driver download) would fail.
</p><p>
Since there no easy way to test for the existence of an installed
network printer from the logon script, the suggestion is: don't bother
checking and just allow the deinstallation/reinstallation to occur
every time a user logs in; it's really quick anyway (1 to 2 seconds).
</p><p>
The additional benefits for this are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It puts in place any printer default setup changes
automatically at every user logon.</p></li><li><p>It allows for &quot;roaming&quot; users' login into the domain from
different workstations.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Since network printers are installed per user this much simplifies the
process of keeping the installation up-to-date. The extra few seconds
at logon time will not really be noticeable. Printers can be centrally
added, changed, and deleted at will on the server with no user
intervention required on the clients (you just need to keep the logon
scripts up to date).
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2923342"></a>The <b class="command">addprinter</b> command</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The <b class="command">addprinter</b> command can be configured to be a
shell script or program executed by Samba. It is triggered by running
the APW from a client against the Samba print server. The APW asks the
user to fill in several fields (such as printer name, driver to be
used, comment, port monitor, etc.). These parameters are passed on to
Samba by the APW. If the addprinter command is designed in a way that
it can create a new printer (through writing correct printcap entries
on legacy systems, or execute the <b class="command">lpadmin</b> command
on more modern systems) and create the associated share in
, then the APW will in effect really
create a new printer on Samba and the UNIX print subsystem!

The basic &quot;NT-style&quot; printer driver management has not changed
considerably in 3.0 over the 2.2.x releases (apart from many small
improvements). Here migration should be quite easy, especially if you
followed previous advice to stop using deprecated parameters in your
setup. For migrations from an existing 2.0.x setup, or if you
continued &quot;Win9x-style&quot; printing in your Samba 2.2 installations, it
is more of an effort. Please read the appropriate release notes and
the HOWTO Collection for 2.2. You can follow several paths.  Here are
possible scenarios for migration:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You need to study and apply the new Windows NT printer
and driver support. Previously used parameters <i class="parameter"><tt>printer
driver file</tt></i>, <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver</tt></i> and
<i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver location</tt></i> are no longer
supported.</p></li><li><p>If you want to take advantage of WinNT printer driver
support you also need to migrate the Win9x/ME drivers to the new
setup.</p></li><li><p>An existing <tt class="filename">printers.def</tt> file
		(the one specified in the now removed parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>printer driver file</tt></i>) will work no longer with samba 3. In
3.0, smbd attempts to locate a Win9x/ME driver files for the printer
in <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> and additional settings in the TDB
and only there; if it fails it will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> (as 2.2.x
used to do) drop down to using a <tt class="filename">printers.def</tt>
(and all associated parameters). The make_printerdef tool is removed
and there is no backwards compatibility for this.</p></li><li><p>You need to install a Windows 9x driver into the
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share for a printer on your Samba
host. The driver files will be stored in the &quot;WIN40/0&quot; subdirectory of
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>, and some other settings and info go
into the printing-related TDBs.</p></li><li><p>If you want to migrate an existing
<tt class="filename">printers.def</tt> file into the new setup, the current
only solution is to use the Windows NT APW to install the NT drivers
and the 9x drivers. This can be scripted using smbclient and
rpcclient. See the Imprints installation client at:
</p><p>
	<a href="http://imprints.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://imprints.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p><p>
for an example. See also the discussion of rpcclient usage in the
