			The Common UNIX Print System (<a href="http://www.cups.org/" target="_top">CUPS</a>) has become very popular. All
			major Linux distributions now ship it as their default printing
			system. To many it is still a very mystical tool.  Mostly, it
			&quot;just works&quot; (TM). People tend to regard it as a &quot;black box&quot;
			which they don't want to look into, as long as it works. But once
			there is a little problem, they are in trouble to find out where to
			start debugging it.  Refer to the &quot;Classical Printing&quot; chapter also, it
			contains a lot of information that is relevant for CUPS.
		</p><p>
			CUPS sports quite a few unique and powerful features. While their
			basic functions may be grasped quite easily, they are also
			new. Because they are different from other, more traditional printing
			systems, it is best to try and not apply any prior knowledge about
			printing upon this new system. Rather, try to understand CUPS
			from the beginning. This documentation will lead you to a
			complete understanding of CUPS. Let's start with the most basic
			things first.
		</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2923811"></a>Overview</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
			CUPS is more than just a print spooling system. It is a complete
			printer management system that complies with the new IPP
			(<span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Printing Protocol</em></span>). IPP is an industry
			and IETF (<span class="emphasis"><em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em></span>)
			standard for network printing. Many of its functions can be managed
			remotely (or locally) via a web browser (giving you a
			platform-independent access to the CUPS print server). Additionally, it
			has the traditional command line and several more modern GUI interfaces
			(GUI interfaces developed by 3rd parties, like KDE's
			overwhelming <a href="http://printing.kde.org/" target="_top">KDEPrint</a>).
		</p><p>
			CUPS allows creation of &quot;raw&quot; printers (ie: NO print file
			format translation) as well as &quot;smart&quot; printers (i.e. CUPS does
			file format conversion as required for the printer). In many ways
			this gives CUPS similar capabilities to the MS Windows print
			monitoring system. Of course, if you are a CUPS advocate, you would
			argue that CUPS is better! In any case, let us now move on to
			explore how one may configure CUPS for interfacing with MS Windows
			print clients via Samba.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2923880"></a>Basic Configuration of CUPS support</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
		Printing with CUPS in the most basic <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> setup in Samba 3.0 (as was true for 2.2.x) only needs two
		settings: <a class="indexterm" name="id2923898"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = cups and
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2923912"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap</tt></i> = cups. CUPS does not need a printcap file.
		However, the <tt class="filename">cupsd.conf</tt> configuration file knows of two related directives that control
		how such a file will be automatically created and maintained by CUPS for the convenience of third party
		applications (example: <i class="parameter"><tt>Printcap /etc/printcap</tt></i> and <i class="parameter"><tt>PrintcapFormat BSD</tt></i>).
		Legacy programs often require the existence of a printcap file containing printer names or they will refuse to
		print. Make sure CUPS is set to generate and maintain a printcap file! For details see
		<b class="command">man cupsd.conf</b> and other CUPS-related documentation, like the wealth of documents on your CUPS server
		itself: <a href="http://localhost:631/documentation.html" target="_top">http://localhost:631/documentation.html</a>.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2923972"></a>Linking of smbd with libcups.so</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
			Samba has a very special relationship to CUPS. Samba can be compiled with CUPS library support.
			Most recent installations have this support enabled. Per default CUPS linking is compiled
			into smbd and other Samba binaries. Of course, you can use CUPS even
			if Samba is not linked against <tt class="filename">libcups.so</tt> -- but
			there are some differences in required or supported configuration
			then.
		</p><p>
			When Samba is compiled against libcups, <a class="indexterm" name="id2924002"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap</tt></i> = cups
			uses the CUPS API to list printers, submit jobs, query queues, etc.  Otherwise it maps to the System V
			commands with an additional <b class="command">-oraw</b> option for printing. On a Linux
			system, you can use the <b class="command">ldd</b> utility to find out details (ldd may not be present on
			other OS platforms, or its function may be embodied by a different command):
		</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>ldd `which smbd`</tt></b>
libssl.so.0.9.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.6 (0x4002d000)
libcrypto.so.0.9.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.6 (0x4005a000)
libcups.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcups.so.2 (0x40123000)
[....]
</pre><p>
			The line <tt class="computeroutput">libcups.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libcups.so.2 (0x40123000)</tt> shows
			there is CUPS support compiled into this version of Samba. If this is the case, and printing = cups
			is set, then <span class="emphasis"><em>any otherwise manually set print command in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> is ignored</em></span>.
			This is an important point to remember!
		</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p> Should it be necessary, for any reason, to set your own print commands, you can do this by setting
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2924097"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = sysv. However, you will loose all the benefits
		of tight CUPS/Samba integration. When you do this you must manually configure the printing system commands
		(most important: <a class="indexterm" name="id2924114"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i>; other commands are
				<a class="indexterm" name="id2924128"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>lppause command</tt></i>,

			To summarize, here is the simplest printing-related setup for <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> to enable basic CUPS support:
		</p><div class="example"><a name="id2924241"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 19.1. Simplest printing-related smb.conf</b></p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printing = cups</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap name = cups</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>comment = All Printers</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>path = /var/spool/samba</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>browseable = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>public = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>writable = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printable = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin = root, @ntadmins</tt></i></td></tr></table></div><p>
			This is all you need for basic printing setup for CUPS. It will print

Here is a slightly more complex printing-related setup
for <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>. It enables general CUPS printing
support for all printers, but defines one printer share which is set
up differently.
</p><div class="example"><a name="id2924426"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 19.2. Overriding global CUPS settings for one printer</b></p><table class="simplelist" border="0" summary="Simple list"><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[global]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printing = cups</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap name = cups</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>load printers = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>comment = All Printers</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>path = /var/spool/samba</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>public = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>writable = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printable = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin = root, @ntadmins</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>[special_printer]</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>comment = A special printer with his own settings</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>path = /var/spool/samba-special</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printing = sysv</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap = lpstat</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>print command = echo &quot;NEW: `date`: printfile %f&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/smbprn.log ; \</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>echo &quot;     `date`: p-%p s-%s f-%f&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/smbprn.log ; \</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>echo &quot;     `date`: j-%j J-%J z-%z c-%c&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/smbprn.log : rm %f</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>public = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>guest ok = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>writeable = no</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printable = yes</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin = kurt</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>hosts deny = 0.0.0.0</tt></i></td></tr><tr><td><i class="parameter"><tt>hosts allow = turbo_xp, 10.160.50.23, 10.160.51.60</tt></i></td></tr></table></div><p>
This special share is only there for testing purposes. It does not write the print job to a file. It just logs the job parameters
known to Samba into the <tt class="filename">/tmp/smbprn.log</tt> file and deletes the jobfile. Moreover, the
<a class="indexterm" name="id2924692"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i> of this share is &quot;kurt&quot; (not the &quot;@ntadmins&quot; group);
guest access is not allowed; the share isn not published to the Network Neighbourhood (so you need to know it is there), and it only
allows access from only three hosts. To prevent CUPS kicking in and taking over the print jobs for that share, we need to set
<a class="indexterm" name="id2924720"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = sysv and
<a class="indexterm" name="id2924733"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap</tt></i> = lpstat.

Before we delve into all the configuration options, let us clarify a few
points. <span class="emphasis"><em>Network printing needs to be organized and setup
correctly</em></span>. Often this is not done correctly. Legacy systems
or small business LAN environments often lack design and good housekeeping.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2924770"></a>Central spooling vs. &quot;Peer-to-Peer&quot; printing</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2924780"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2924790"></a><p>
Many small office or home networks, as well as badly organized larger
environments, allow each client a direct access to available network
printers. This is generally a bad idea. It often blocks one client's
access to the printer when another client's job is printing. It also
might freeze the first client's application while it is waiting to get
rid of the job. Also, there are frequent complaints about various jobs
being printed with their pages mixed with each other. A better concept
is the usage of a &quot;print server&quot;: it routes all jobs through one
central system, which responds immediately, takes jobs from multiple
concurrent clients at the same time and in turn transfers them to the
printer(s) in the correct order.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2924825"></a>CUPS/Samba as a &quot;spooling-only&quot; Print Server; &quot;raw&quot; printing
with Vendor Drivers on Windows Clients</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2924835"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2924844"></a><p>
Most traditionally configured UNIX print servers acting on behalf of
Samba's Windows clients represented a really simple setup. Their only
task was to manage the &quot;raw&quot; spooling of all jobs handed to them by
Samba. This approach meant that the Windows clients were expected to
prepare the print job file that it s ready to be sent to the printing
device. Here a native (vendor-supplied) Windows printer
driver for the target device needed to be installed on each and every
client.
</p><p>
It is possible to configure CUPS, Samba and your Windows clients in the
same, traditional and simple way. When CUPS printers are configured
for RAW print-through mode operation it is the responsibility of the
Samba client to fully render the print job (file). The file must be
sent in a format that is suitable for direct delivery to the
printer. Clients need to run the vendor-provided drivers to do
this. In this case CUPS will NOT do any print file format conversion
work.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2924894"></a>Driver Installation Methods on Windows Clients</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The printer drivers on the Windows clients may be installed
in two functionally different ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>manually install the drivers locally on each client,
one by one; this yields the old <span class="emphasis"><em>LanMan</em></span> style
printing; it uses a <tt class="filename">\\sambaserver\printershare</tt>
type of connection.</p></li><li><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2924937"></a>
		deposit and prepare the drivers (for later download) on
the print server (Samba); this enables the clients to use
&quot;Point and Print&quot; to get drivers semi-automatically installed the
first time they access the printer; with this method NT/2K/XP
clients use the <span class="emphasis"><em>SPOOLSS/MS-RPC</em></span>
type printing calls.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The second method is recommended for use over the first.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2924971"></a>Explicitly enable &quot;raw&quot; printing for
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/octet-stream</em></span>!</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2924984"></a><p>
If you use the first option (drivers are installed on the client
side), there is one setting to take care of: CUPS needs to be told
that it should allow &quot;raw&quot; printing of deliberate (binary) file
formats. The CUPS files that need to be correctly set for RAW mode
printers to work are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/cups/mime.types
</p></li><li><p>/etc/cups/mime.convs</p></li></ul></div><p>
Both contain entries (at the end of the respective files) which must
be uncommented to allow RAW mode operation.
In<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt> make sure this line is
present:
</p><pre class="screen">
 application/octet-stream
</pre><p>
In <tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.convs</tt>,
have this line:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2925053"></a><pre class="screen">
 application/octet-stream   application/vnd.cups-raw   0   - 
</pre><p>
If these two files are not set up correctly for raw Windows client
printing, you may encounter the dreaded <tt class="computeroutput">Unable to
convert file 0</tt> in your CUPS error_log file. 
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>editing the <tt class="filename">mime.convs</tt> and the

<span class="emphasis"><em>allows</em></span> it.
</p></div><p><b>Background. </b><a class="indexterm" name="id2925119"></a>
CUPS being a more security-aware printing system than traditional ones
does not by default allow a user to send deliberate (possibly binary)
data to printing devices. This could be easily abused to launch a
&quot;Denial of Service&quot; attack on your printer(s), causing at the least
the loss of a lot of paper and ink. &quot;Unknown&quot; data are tagged by CUPS
as <span class="emphasis"><em>MIME type: application/octet-stream</em></span> and not
allowed to go to the printer. By default, you can only send other
(known) MIME types &quot;raw&quot;. Sending data &quot;raw&quot; means that CUPS does not
try to convert them and passes them to the printer untouched (see next
chapter for even more background explanations).
</p><p>
This is all you need to know to get the CUPS/Samba combo printing
&quot;raw&quot; files prepared by Windows clients, which have vendor drivers
locally installed. If you are not interested in background information about
more advanced CUPS/Samba printing, simply skip the remaining sections
of this chapter.

If you want to use the MS-RPC type printing, you must upload the
drivers onto the Samba server first (<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share). For a discussion on how to deposit printer drivers on the
Samba host (so that the Windows clients can download and use them via
&quot;Point'n'Print&quot;) please also refer to the previous chapter of this
HOWTO Collection. There you will find a description or reference to
three methods of preparing the client drivers on the Samba server:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2925224"></a><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the GUI, &quot;Add Printer Wizard&quot;
<span class="emphasis"><em>upload-from-a-Windows-client</em></span>

<a class="indexterm" name="id2925264"></a>
		the <span class="emphasis"><em>Imprints</em></span> Toolset
method.</p></li></ul></div><p>
These 3 methods apply to CUPS all the same. A new and more
convenient way to load the Windows drivers into Samba is provided
if you use CUPS:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2925285"></a><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsaddsmb</em></span>
utility.</p></li></ul></div><p>
cupsaddsmb is discussed in much detail further below. But we will
first explore the CUPS filtering system and compare the Windows and
UNIX printing architectures.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2925317"></a>Using CUPS/Samba in an advanced Way -- intelligent printing

Are you still following this? Good. Let's go into more detail then. We now know
how to set up a &quot;dump&quot; printserver, that is, a server which is spooling
printjobs &quot;raw&quot;, leaving the print data untouched.
</p><p>
Possibly you need to setup CUPS in a more smart way. The reasons could
be manifold:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Maybe your boss wants to get monthly statistics: Which
printer did how many pages? What was the average data size of a job?
What was the average print run per day? What are the typical hourly
peaks in printing? Which departments prints how
much?</p></li><li><p>Maybe you are asked to setup a print quota system:
users should not be able to print more jobs, once they have surpassed
a given limit per period?</p></li><li><p>Maybe your previous network printing setup is a mess
and shall be re-organized from a clean beginning?</p></li><li><p>Maybe you have experiencing too many &quot;Blue Screens&quot;,
originating from poorly debugged printer drivers running in NT &quot;kernel
mode&quot;?</p></li></ul></div><p>
These goals cannot be achieved by a raw print server. To build a
server meeting these requirements, you'll first need to learn about
how CUPS works and how you can enable its features.
</p><p>
What follows is the comparison of some fundamental concepts for
Windows and UNIX printing; then is the time for a description of the
CUPS filtering system, how it works and how you can tweak it.

Network printing is one of the most complicated and error-prone
day-to-day tasks any user or an administrator may encounter. This is
true for all OS platforms. And there are reasons for this.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2925447"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2925456"></a><p>
You can't expect for most file formats to just throw them towards
printers and they get printed. There needs to be a file format
conversion in between. The problem is: there is no common standard for
print file formats across all manufacturers and printer types.  While
<span class="emphasis"><em>PostScript</em></span> (trademark held by Adobe), and, to an
extent, <span class="emphasis"><em>PCL</em></span> (trademark held by HP), have developed
into semi-official &quot;standards&quot;, by being the most widely used PDLs
(<span class="emphasis"><em>Page Description Languages</em></span>), there are still
many manufacturers who &quot;roll their own&quot; (their reasons may be
unacceptable license fees for using printer-embedded PostScript
interpreters, etc.).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2925497"></a>Windows Drivers, GDI and EMF</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2925505"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2925514"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2925522"></a><p>
In Windows OS, the format conversion job is done by the printer
drivers. On MS Windows OS platforms all application programmers have
at their disposal a built-in API, the GDI (<span class="emphasis"><em>Graphical Device
Interface</em></span>), as part and parcel of the OS itself, to base
themselves on. This GDI core is used as one common unified ground, for
all Windows programs, to draw pictures, fonts and documents
<span class="emphasis"><em>on screen</em></span> as well as <span class="emphasis"><em>on
paper</em></span> (=print). Therefore printer driver developers can
standardize on a well-defined GDI output for their own driver
input. Achieving WYSIWYG (&quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;) is
relatively easy, because the on-screen graphic primitives, as well as
the on-paper drawn objects, come from one common source. This source,
the GDI, produces often a file format called EMF (<span class="emphasis"><em>Enhanced
MetaFile</em></span>). The EMF is processed by the printer driver and
converted to the printer-specific file format.

<a class="indexterm" name="id2925583"></a>
To the GDI foundation in MS Windows, Apple has chosen to
put paper and screen output on a common foundation for their
(BSD-UNIX-based, did you know??) Mac OS X and Darwin Operating
Systems. Their <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Graphic Engine</em></span> uses a
<span class="emphasis"><em>PDF</em></span> derivative for all display work.

In UNIX and Linux, there is no comparable layer built into the OS
kernel(s) or the X (screen display) server. Every application is
responsible for itself to create its print output.  Fortunately, most
use PostScript. That gives at least some common ground. Unfortunately,
there are many different levels of quality for this PostScript. And
worse: there is a huge difference (and no common root) in the way how
the same document is displayed on screen and how it is presented on
paper. WYSIWYG is more difficult to achieve. This goes back to the
time decades ago, when the predecessors of <span class="emphasis"><em>X.org</em></span>,
designing the UNIX foundations and protocols for Graphical User
Interfaces refused to take over responsibility for &quot;paper output&quot;
also, as some had demanded at the time, and restricted itself to
&quot;on-screen only&quot;.  (For some years now, the &quot;Xprint&quot; project has been
under development, attempting to build printing support into the X
framework, including a PostScript and a PCL driver, but it is not yet
ready for prime time.) You can see this unfavorable inheritance up to
the present day by looking into the various &quot;font&quot; directories on your
system; there are separate ones for fonts used for X display and fonts
to be used on paper.
</p><p><b>Background. </b><a class="indexterm" name="id2925741"></a>
The PostScript programming language is an &quot;invention&quot; by Adobe Inc.,
but its specifications have been published to the full. Its strength
lies in its powerful abilities to describe graphical objects (fonts,
shapes, patterns, lines, curves, dots...), their attributes (color,
linewidth...) and the way to manipulate (scale, distort, rotate,
shift...) them.  Because of its open specification, anybody with the
skill can start writing his own implementation of a PostScript
interpreter and use it to display PostScript files on screen or on
paper. Most graphical output devices are based on the concept of
&quot;raster images&quot; or &quot;pixels&quot; (one notable exception are pen
plotters). Of course, you can look at a PostScript file in its textual
form and you will be reading its PostScript code, the language
instructions which need to be interpreted by a rasterizer. Rasterizers
produce pixel images, which may be displayed on screen by a viewer
program or on paper by a printer.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="post-and-ghost"></a>PostScript and Ghostscript</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2925792"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2925800"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2925811"></a><p>
So, UNIX is lacking a common ground for printing on paper and
displaying on screen. Despite this unfavorable legacy for UNIX, basic
printing is fairly easy: if you have PostScript printers at your
disposal! The reason is: these devices have a built-in PostScript
language &quot;interpreter&quot;, also called a <span class="emphasis"><em>Raster Image
Processor</em></span> (RIP), (which makes them more expensive than
other types of printers); throw PostScript towards them, and they will
spit out your printed pages. Their RIP is doing all the hard work of
converting the PostScript drawing commands into a bitmap picture as
you see it on paper, in a resolution as done by your printer. This is
no different to PostScript printing of a file from a Windows origin.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2925853"></a>
Traditional UNIX programs and printing systems -- while
using PostScript -- are largely not PPD-aware. PPDs are &quot;PostScript
Printer Description&quot; files. They enable you to specify and control all
options a printer supports: duplexing, stapling, punching... Therefore
UNIX users for a long time couldn't choose many of the supported
device and job options, unlike Windows or Apple users. But now there
is CUPS....
</p></div><p>

</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2925928"></a><p>
However, there are other types of printers out there. These don't know
how to print PostScript. They use their own <span class="emphasis"><em>Page Description
Language</em></span> (PDL, often proprietary). To print to them is much
more demanding. Since your UNIX applications mostly produce
PostScript, and since these devices don't understand PostScript, you
need to convert the printfiles to a format suitable for your printer
on the host, before you can send it away.

Here is where <span class="emphasis"><em>Ghostscript</em></span> kicks in. Ghostscript is
the traditional (and quite powerful) PostScript interpreter used on
UNIX platforms. It is a RIP in software, capable to do a
<span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of file format conversions, for a very broad
spectrum of hardware devices as well as software file formats.
Ghostscript technology and drivers is what enables PostScript printing
to non-PostScript hardware.
</p><p>
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="small3"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.3. Ghostscript as a RIP for non-postscript printers</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/3small.png" width="270" alt="Ghostscript as a RIP for non-postscript printers"></div></div><p>
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
Use the &quot;gs -h&quot; command to check for all built-in &quot;devices&quot; of your
Ghostscript version. If you specify e.g. a parameter of
<i class="parameter"><tt>-sDEVICE=png256</tt></i> on your Ghostscript command
line, you are asking Ghostscript to convert the input into a PNG
file. Naming a &quot;device&quot; on the commandline is the most important
single parameter to tell Ghostscript how exactly it should render the
input. New Ghostscript versions are released at fairly regular
intervals, now by artofcode LLC. They are initially put under the
&quot;AFPL&quot; license, but re-released under the GNU GPL as soon as the next
AFPL version appears. GNU Ghostscript is probably the version
installed on most Samba systems. But it has got some
deficiencies. <a class="indexterm" name="id2926066"></a>Therefore ESP Ghostscript was developed as an
enhancement over GNU Ghostscript, with lots of bug-fixes, additional
devices and improvements. It is jointly maintained by developers from
CUPS, Gimp-Print, MandrakeSoft, SuSE, RedHat and Debian. It includes
the &quot;cups&quot; device (essential to print to non-PS printers from CUPS).

While PostScript in essence is a <span class="emphasis"><em>Page Description
Language</em></span> (PDL) to represent the page layout in a
<span class="emphasis"><em>device independent</em></span> way, real world print jobs are
always ending up to be output on a hardware with device-specific
features. To take care of all the differences in hardware, and to
allow for innovations, Adobe has specified a syntax and file format
for <span class="emphasis"><em>PostScript Printer Description</em></span> (PPD)
files. Every PostScript printer ships with one of these files.
</p><p>
PPDs contain all information about general and special features of the
given printer model: Which different resolutions can it handle? Does
it have a Duplexing Unit? How many paper trays are there? What media
types and sizes does it take? For each item it also names the special
command string to be sent to the printer (mostly inside the PostScript
file) in order to enable it.
</p><p>
Information from these PPDs is meant to be taken into account by the
printer drivers. Therefore, installed as part of the Windows
PostScript driver for a given printer is the printer's PPD. Where it
makes sense, the PPD features are presented in the drivers' UI dialogs
to display to the user as choice of print options. In the end, the
user selections are somehow written (in the form of special
PostScript, PJL, JCL or vendor-dependent commands) into the PostScript
file created by the driver.
</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2926162"></a>
A PostScript file that was created to contain device-specific commands
for achieving a certain print job output (e.g. duplexed, stapled and
punched) on a specific target machine, may not print as expected, or
may not be printable at all on other models; it also may not be fit
for further processing by software (e.g. by a PDF distilling program).

CUPS can handle all spec-compliant PPDs as supplied by the
manufacturers for their PostScript models. Even if a
UNIX/Linux-illiterate vendor might not have mentioned our favorite
OS in his manuals and brochures -- you can safely trust this:
<span class="emphasis"><em>if you get hold of the Windows NT version of the PPD, you
can use it unchanged in CUPS</em></span> and thus access the full
power of your printer just like a Windows NT user could!
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
To check the spec compliance of any PPD online, go to <a href="http://www.cups.org/testppd.php" target="_top">http://www.cups.org/testppd.php</a>
and upload your PPD. You will see the results displayed
immediately. CUPS in all versions after 1.1.19 has a much more strict
internal PPD parsing and checking code enabled; in case of printing
trouble this online resource should be one of your first pitstops.

For real PostScript printers <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> use the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Foomatic</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsomatic</em></span>

If you are looking for an original vendor-provided PPD of a specific

your LAN has the PostScript driver installed, just use
<b class="command">smbclient //NT4-box/print\$ -U username</b> to
access the Windows directory where all printer driver files are

CUPS also uses specially crafted PPDs to handle non-PostScript
printers. These PPDs are usually not available from the vendors (and
no, you can't just take the PPD of a Postscript printer with the same
model name and hope it works for the non-PostScript version too). To
understand how these PPDs work for non-PS printers we first need to
dive deeply into the CUPS filtering and file format conversion
architecture. Stay tuned.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2926306"></a>The CUPS Filtering Architecture</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The core of the CUPS filtering system is based on
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ghostscript</em></span>. In addition to Ghostscript, CUPS
uses some other filters of its own. You (or your OS vendor) may have
plugged in even more filters. CUPS handles all data file formats under
the label of various <span class="emphasis"><em>MIME types</em></span>. Every incoming
printfile is subjected to an initial
<span class="emphasis"><em>auto-typing</em></span>. The auto-typing determines its given
MIME type. A given MIME type implies zero or more possible filtering
chains relevant to the selected target printer. This section discusses
how MIME types recognition and conversion rules interact. They are
used by CUPS to automatically setup a working filtering chain for any
given input data format.
</p><p>
If CUPS rasterizes a PostScript file <span class="emphasis"><em>natively</em></span> to
a bitmap, this is done in 2 stages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the first stage uses a Ghostscript device named &quot;cups&quot;
(this is since version 1.1.15) and produces a generic raster format
called &quot;CUPS raster&quot;.
</p></li><li><p>the second stage uses a &quot;raster driver&quot; which converts
the generic CUPS raster to a device specific raster.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Make sure your Ghostscript version has the &quot;cups&quot; device compiled in
(check with <b class="command">gs -h | grep cups</b>).  Otherwise you
may encounter the dreaded <tt class="computeroutput">Unable to convert file
0</tt> in your CUPS error_log file. To have &quot;cups&quot; as a
device in your Ghostscript, you either need to <span class="emphasis"><em>patch GNU
Ghostscript</em></span> and re-compile or use <a class="indexterm" name="id2926410"></a><a href="http://www.cups.org/ghostscript.php" target="_top">ESP Ghostscript</a>. The
superior alternative is ESP Ghostscript: it supports not just CUPS,
but 300 other devices too (while GNU Ghostscript supports only about
180). Because of this broad output device support, ESP Ghostscript is
the first choice for non-CUPS spoolers too. It is now recommended by
Linuxprinting.org for all spoolers.
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2926437"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2926446"></a>
CUPS printers may be setup to use <span class="emphasis"><em>external</em></span>
rendering paths. One of the most common ones is provided by the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Foomatic/cupsomatic</em></span> concept, from <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/" target="_top">Linuxprinting.org</a>.  This
uses the classical Ghostscript approach, doing everything in one
step. It doesn't use the &quot;cups&quot; device, but one of the many
others. However, even for Foomatic/cupsomatic usage, best results and
<a class="indexterm" name="id2926483"></a>
broadest printer model support is provided by ESP Ghostscript (more
about cupsomatic/Foomatic, particularly the new version called now
<span class="emphasis"><em>foomatic-rip</em></span>, follows below).
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2926501"></a>MIME types and CUPS Filters</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2926512"></a>
CUPS reads the file <tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt>
(and all other files carrying a <tt class="filename">*.types</tt> suffix
in the same directory) upon startup. These files contain the MIME
type recognition rules which are applied when CUPS runs its
auto-typing routines. The rule syntax is explained in the man page
for <tt class="filename">mime.types</tt> and in the comments section of the
<tt class="filename">mime.types</tt> file itself. A simple rule reads
like this:
</p><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2926558"></a>
</p><pre class="screen">
 application/pdf         pdf string(0,%PDF)
</pre><p>
This means: if a filename has either a
<tt class="filename">.pdf</tt> suffix, or if the magic
string <span class="emphasis"><em>%PDF</em></span> is right at the
beginning of the file itself (offset 0 from the start), then it is
a PDF file (<span class="emphasis"><em>application/pdf</em></span>).
Another rule is this: 
</p><pre class="screen">
 application/postscript  ai eps ps string(0,%!) string(0,&lt;04&gt;%!)
</pre><p>
Its meaning: if the filename has one of the suffixes
<tt class="filename">.ai</tt>, <tt class="filename">.eps</tt>,
<tt class="filename">.ps</tt> or if the file itself starts with one of the
strings <span class="emphasis"><em>%!</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;04&gt;%!</em></span>, it
is a generic PostScript file
(<span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span>).
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
There is a very important difference between two similar MIME type in
CUPS: one is <span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span>, the other is
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span>. While
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span> is meant to be device
independent (job options for the file are still outside the PS file
content, embedded in commandline or environment variables by CUPS),
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span> may have the job
options inserted into the PostScript data itself (were
applicable). The transformation of the generic PostScript
(application/postscript) to the device-specific version
(application/vnd.cups-postscript) is the responsibility of the
CUPS <span class="emphasis"><em>pstops</em></span> filter. pstops uses information
contained in the PPD to do the transformation.
</p></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
Don't confuse the other mime.types file your system might be using
with the one in the <tt class="filename">/etc/cups/</tt> directory.
</p></div><p>
CUPS can handle ASCII text, HP-GL, PDF, PostScript, DVI and a
lot of image formats (GIF. PNG, TIFF, JPEG, Photo-CD, SUN-Raster,
PNM, PBM, SGI-RGB and some more) and their associated MIME types
with its filters.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2926707"></a>MIME type Conversion Rules</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2926716"></a><p>
CUPS reads the file <tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.convs</tt>
(and all other files named with a <tt class="filename">*.convs</tt>
suffix in the same directory) upon startup. These files contain
lines naming an input MIME type, an output MIME type, a format
conversion filter which can produce the output from the input type
and virtual costs associated with this conversion. One example line
reads like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
 application/pdf         application/postscript   33   pdftops
</pre><p>
This means that the <span class="emphasis"><em>pdftops</em></span> filter will take
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/pdf</em></span> as input and produce
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span> as output, the virtual
cost of this operation is 33 CUPS-$. The next filter is more
expensive, costing 66 CUPS-$:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2926777"></a><pre class="screen">
 application/vnd.hp-HPGL application/postscript   66   hpgltops
</pre><p>
This is the <span class="emphasis"><em>hpgltops</em></span>, which processes HP-GL
plotter files to PostScript.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2926804"></a><pre class="screen">
 application/octet-stream
</pre><p>
Here are two more examples: 
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2926827"></a><pre class="screen">
 application/x-shell     application/postscript   33    texttops
 text/plain              application/postscript   33    texttops
</pre><p>
The last two examples name the <span class="emphasis"><em>texttops</em></span> filter
to work on &quot;text/plain&quot; as well as on &quot;application/x-shell&quot;. (Hint:
this differentiation is needed for the syntax highlighting feature of
&quot;texttops&quot;).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2926862"></a>Filter Requirements</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2926870"></a><p>
There are many more combinations named in mime.convs.  However, you
are not limited to use the ones pre-defined there. You can plug in any
filter you like into the CUPS framework. It must meet, or must be made
to meet some minimal requirements. If you find (or write) a cool
conversion filter of some kind, make sure it complies to what CUPS
needs, and put in the right lines in <tt class="filename">mime.types</tt>
and <tt class="filename">mime.convs</tt>, then it will work seamlessly
inside CUPS!
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
The mentioned &quot;CUPS requirements&quot; for filters are simple. Take
filenames or <tt class="filename">stdin</tt> as input and write to
<tt class="filename">stdout</tt>. They should take these 5 or 6 arguments:
<span class="emphasis"><em>printer job user title copies options [filename]</em></span>
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Printer</span></dt><dd><p>The name of the printer queue (normally this is the
name of the filter being run)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">job</span></dt><dd><p>The numeric job ID for the job being
printed</p></dd><dt><span class="term">user</span></dt><dd><p>The string from the originating-user-name
attribute</p></dd><dt><span class="term">title</span></dt><dd><p>The string from the job-name attribute</p></dd><dt><span class="term">copies</span></dt><dd><p>The numeric value from the number-copies
attribute</p></dd><dt><span class="term">options</span></dt><dd><p>The job options</p></dd><dt><span class="term">filename</span></dt><dd><p>(Optionally) The print request file (if missing,
filters expected data fed through <tt class="filename">stdin</tt>). In most
cases it is very easy to write a simple wrapper script around existing
filters to make them work with CUPS.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2927043"></a>Prefilters</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2927050"></a><p>
As was said, PostScript is the central file format to any UNIX based
printing system. From PostScript, CUPS generates raster data to feed
non-PostScript printers.
</p><p>
But what is happening if you send one of the supported non-PS formats
to print? Then CUPS runs &quot;pre-filters&quot; on these input formats to
generate PostScript first. There are pre-filters to create PS from
ASCII text, PDF, DVI or HP-GL. The outcome of these filters is always
of MIME type <span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span> (meaning that
any device-specific print options are not yet embedded into the
PostScript by CUPS, and that the next filter to be called is
pstops). Another pre-filter is running on all supported image formats,
the <span class="emphasis"><em>imagetops</em></span> filter. Its outcome is always of
MIME type <span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span>
(<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> application/postscript), meaning it has the
print options already embedded into the file.

<span class="emphasis"><em>pstoraster</em></span> is at the core of the CUPS filtering
system. It is responsible for the first stage of the rasterization
process. Its input is of MIME type application/vnd.cups-postscript;
its output is application/vnd.cups-raster. This output format is not
yet meant to be printable. Its aim is to serve as a general purpose
input format for more specialized <span class="emphasis"><em>raster drivers</em></span>,
that are able to generate device-specific printer data.
</p><p>
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="small6"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.6. Postscript to intermediate Raster format</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/6small.png" width="270" alt="Postscript to intermediate Raster format"></div></div><p>
</p><p>
CUPS raster is a generic raster format with powerful features. It is
able to include per-page information, color profiles and more to be
used by the following downstream raster drivers. Its MIME type is
registered with IANA and its specification is of course completely
open. It is designed to make it very easy and inexpensive for
manufacturers to develop Linux and UNIX raster drivers for their
printer models, should they choose to do so. CUPS always takes care
for the first stage of rasterization so these vendors don't need to care
about Ghostscript complications (in fact, there is currently more
than one vendor financing the development of CUPS raster drivers).

</p><p>
CUPS versions before version 1.1.15 were shipping a binary (or source
code) standalone filter, named &quot;pstoraster&quot;. pstoraster was derived
from GNU Ghostscript 5.50, and could be installed besides and in
addition to any GNU or AFPL Ghostscript package without conflicting.
</p><p>
From version 1.1.15, this has changed. The functions for this has been
integrated back into Ghostscript (now based on GNU Ghostscript version
7.05). The &quot;pstoraster&quot; filter is now a simple shell script calling
<b class="command">gs</b> with the <b class="command">-sDEVICE=cups</b>
parameter. If your Ghostscript doesn't show a success on asking for
<b class="command">gs -h |grep cups</b>, you might not be able to
print. Update your Ghostscript then!

Above in the section about prefilters, we mentioned the prefilter
that generates PostScript from image formats. The imagetoraster
filter is used to convert directly from image to raster, without the
intermediate PostScript stage. It is used more often than the above
mentioned prefilters. Here is a summarizing flowchart of image file
filtering:

CUPS ships with quite some different raster drivers processing CUPS
raster. On my system I find in /usr/lib/cups/filter/ these:

than this; some of these are installed by commercial add-ons to CUPS
(like <i class="parameter"><tt>rastertoturboprint</tt></i>), others (like
<i class="parameter"><tt>rastertoprinter</tt></i>) by 3rd party driver

The last part of any CUPS filtering chain is a &quot;backend&quot;.  Backends
are special programs that send the print-ready file to the final
device. There is a separate backend program for any transfer
&quot;protocol&quot; of sending printjobs over the network, or for every local
interface. Every CUPS printqueue needs to have a CUPS &quot;device-URI&quot;
associated with it. The device URI is the way to encode the backend
used to send the job to its destination. Network device-URIs are using
two slashes in their syntax, local device URIs only one, as you can
see from the following list. Keep in mind that local interface names
may vary much from my examples, if your OS is not Linux:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">usb</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to USB-connected printers. An
example for the CUPS device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">usb:/dev/usb/lp0</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">serial</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to serially connected printers.
An example for the CUPS device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">serial:/dev/ttyS0?baud=11500</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">parallel</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to printers connected to the
parallel port. An example for the CUPS device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">parallel:/dev/lp0</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">scsi</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to printers attached to the
SCSI interface. An example for the CUPS device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">scsi:/dev/sr1</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">lpd</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to LPR/LPD connected network
printers. An example for the CUPS device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">lpd://remote_host_name/remote_queue_name</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">AppSocket/HP JetDirect</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to AppSocket (a.k.a. &quot;HP
JetDirect&quot;) connected network printers. An example for the CUPS
device-URI to use is:
<tt class="filename">socket://10.11.12.13:9100</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">ipp</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to IPP connected network
printers (or to other CUPS servers). Examples for CUPS device-URIs
to use are:
<tt class="filename">ipp:://192.193.194.195/ipp</tt>
(for many HP printers) or
<tt class="filename">ipp://remote_cups_server/printers/remote_printer_name</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">http</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to HTTP connected printers.
(The http:// CUPS backend is only a symlink to the ipp:// backend.)
Examples for the CUPS device-URIs to use are:
<tt class="filename">http:://192.193.194.195:631/ipp</tt>
(for many HP printers) or
<tt class="filename">http://remote_cups_server:631/printers/remote_printer_name</tt>
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">smb</span></dt><dd><p>
This backend sends printfiles to printers shared by a Windows
host. An example for CUPS device-URIs to use are:
<tt class="filename">smb://workgroup/server/printersharename</tt>
Or
<tt class="filename">smb://server/printersharename</tt>
or
<tt class="filename">smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printersharename</tt>
or
<tt class="filename">smb://username:password@server/printersharename</tt>.
The smb:// backend is a symlink to the Samba utility
<span class="emphasis"><em>smbspool</em></span> (doesn't ship with CUPS). If the
symlink is not present in your CUPS backend directory, have your
root user create it: <b class="command">ln -s `which smbspool`
/usr/lib/cups/backend/smb</b>.
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
It is easy to write your own backends as Shell or Perl scripts, if you
need any modification or extension to the CUPS print system. One
reason could be that you want to create &quot;special&quot; printers which send
the printjobs as email (through a &quot;mailto:/&quot; backend), convert them to
PDF (through a &quot;pdfgen:/&quot; backend) or dump them to &quot;/dev/null&quot; (In
fact I have the system-wide default printer set up to be connected to
a &quot;devnull:/&quot; backend: there are just too many people sending jobs
without specifying a printer, or scripts and programs which don't name
a printer. The system-wide default deletes the job and sends a polite
mail back to the $USER asking him to always specify a correct
printername).
</p><p>
Not all of the mentioned backends may be present on your system or
usable (depending on your hardware configuration). One test for all
available CUPS backends is provided by the <span class="emphasis"><em>lpinfo</em></span>
utility. Used with the <tt class="option">-v</tt> parameter, it lists
all available backends:

&quot;cupsomatic&quot; filters may be the most widely used on CUPS
installations. You must be clear about the fact that these were not
developed by the CUPS people. They are a &quot;Third Party&quot; add-on to
CUPS. They utilize the traditional Ghostscript devices to render jobs
for CUPS. When troubleshooting, you should know about the
difference. Here the whole rendering process is done in one stage,
inside Ghostscript, using an appropriate &quot;device&quot; for the target
printer. cupsomatic uses PPDs which are generated from the &quot;Foomatic&quot;
Printer &amp; Driver Database at Linuxprinting.org.
</p><p>
You can recognize these PPDs from the line calling the
<span class="emphasis"><em>cupsomatic</em></span> filter:
</p><pre class="screen">
 *cupsFilter: &quot;application/vnd.cups-postscript  0  cupsomatic&quot;
</pre><p>
This line you may find amongst the first 40 or so lines of the PPD
file. If you have such a PPD installed, the printer shows up in the
CUPS web interface with a <span class="emphasis"><em>foomatic</em></span> namepart for
the driver description. cupsomatic is a Perl script that runs
Ghostscript, with all the complicated commandline options
auto-constructed from the selected PPD and commandline options give to
the printjob.
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2928111"></a><p>
However, cupsomatic is now deprecated. Its PPDs (especially the first
generation of them, still in heavy use out there) are not meeting the
Adobe specifications. You might also suffer difficulties when you try
to download them with &quot;Point'n'Print&quot; to Windows clients. A better,
and more powerful successor is now in a very stable Beta-version
available: it is called <span class="emphasis"><em>foomatic-rip</em></span>. To use
foomatic-rip as a filter with CUPS, you need the new-type PPDs.  These
have a similar, but different line:
</p><pre class="screen">

 *cupsFilter: &quot;application/vnd.cups-postscript  0  foomatic-rip&quot;

</pre><p>
The PPD generating engine at Linuxprinting.org has been revamped.
The new PPDs comply to the Adobe spec. On top, they also provide a
new way to specify different quality levels (hi-res photo, normal
color, grayscale, draft...) with a single click (whereas before you
could have required 5 or more different selections (media type,
resolution, inktype, dithering algorithm...). There is support for
custom-size media built in. There is support to switch
print-options from page to page, in the middle of a job. And the
best thing is: the new foomatic-rip now works seamlessly with all
legacy spoolers too (like LPRng, BSD-LPD, PDQ, PPR etc.), providing
for them access to use PPDs for their printing!
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2928168"></a>The Complete Picture</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
If you want to see an overview over all the filters and how they
relate to each other, the complete picture of the puzzle is at the end
of this document.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2928183"></a><tt class="filename">mime.convs</tt></h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
CUPS auto-constructs all possible filtering chain paths for any given
MIME type, and every printer installed. But how does it decide in
favor or against a specific alternative?  (There may often be cases,
where there is a choice of two or more possible filtering chains for
the same target printer). Simple: you may have noticed the figures in
the 3rd column of the mime.convs file. They represent virtual costs
assigned to this filter. Every possible filtering chain will sum up to
a total &quot;filter cost&quot;. CUPS decides for the most &quot;inexpensive&quot; route.
</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3><p>
The setting of <i class="parameter"><tt>FilterLimit 1000</tt></i> in
<tt class="filename">cupsd.conf</tt> will not allow more filters to
run concurrently than will consume a total of 1000 virtual filter
cost. This is a very efficient way to limit the load of any CUPS
server by setting an appropriate &quot;FilterLimit&quot; value. A FilterLimit of
200 allows roughly 1 job at a time, while a FilterLimit of 1000 allows
approximately 5 jobs maximum at a time.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2928246"></a>&quot;Raw&quot; printing</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
You can tell CUPS to print (nearly) any file &quot;raw&quot;. &quot;Raw&quot; means it
will not be filtered. CUPS will send the file to the printer &quot;as is&quot;
without bothering if the printer is able to digest it. Users need to
take care themselves that they send sensible data formats only. Raw
printing can happen on any queue if the &quot;-o raw&quot; option is specified
on the command line. You can also set up raw-only queues by simply not
associating any PPD with it. This command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">$ </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -P rawprinter -v socket://11.12.13.14:9100 -E</tt></b>
</pre><p>
sets up a queue named &quot;rawprinter&quot;, connected via the &quot;socket&quot;
protocol (a.k.a. &quot;HP JetDirect&quot;) to the device at IP address
11.12.1.3.14, using port 9100. (If you had added a PPD with
<b class="command">-P /path/to/PPD</b> to this command line, you would
have installed a &quot;normal&quot; printqueue.
</p><p>
CUPS will automatically treat each job sent to a queue as a &quot;raw&quot; one,
if it can't find a PPD associated with the queue.  However, CUPS will
only send known MIME types (as defined in its own mime.types file) and
refuse others.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2928335"></a>&quot;application/octet-stream&quot; printing</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Any MIME type with no rule in the
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt> file is regarded as unknown
or <span class="emphasis"><em>application/octet-stream</em></span> and will not be
sent. Because CUPS refuses to print unknown MIME types per default,
you will probably have experienced the fact that printjobs originating
from Windows clients were not printed. You may have found an error
message in your CUPS logs like:
</p><pre class="screen">
 Unable to convert file 0 to printable format for job
</pre><p>
To enable the printing of &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; files, edit
these two files:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.convs</tt></p></li><li><p><tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt></p></li></ul></div><p>
Both contain entries (at the end of the respective files) which must
be uncommented to allow RAW mode operation for
application/octet-stream. In <tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt>
make sure this line is present:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2928420"></a><pre class="screen">
 application/octet-stream
</pre><p>
This line (with no specific auto-typing rule set) makes all files
not otherwise auto-typed a member of application/octet-stream. In
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.convs</tt>, have this
line: 
</p><pre class="screen">
 application/octet-stream   application/vnd.cups-raw   0   -
</pre><a class="indexterm" name="id2928460"></a><p>
This line tells CUPS to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>Null Filter</em></span>
(denoted as &quot;-&quot;, doing... nothing at all) on
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/octet-stream</em></span>, and tag the result as
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-raw</em></span>. This last one is
always a green light to the CUPS scheduler to now hand the file over
to the &quot;backend&quot; connecting to the printer and sending it over.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p> Editing the <tt class="filename">mime.convs</tt> and the

<span class="emphasis"><em>allows</em></span> it.
</p></div><p><b>Background. </b>
CUPS being a more security-aware printing system than traditional ones
does not by default allow one to send deliberate (possibly binary)
data to printing devices.  (This could be easily abused to launch a
Denial of Service attack on your printer(s), causing at least the loss
of a lot of paper and ink...) &quot;Unknown&quot; data are regarded by CUPS
as <span class="emphasis"><em>MIME type</em></span>
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/octet-stream</em></span>. While you
<span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> send data &quot;raw&quot;, the MIME type for these must
be one that is known to CUPS and an allowed one. The file
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt> defines the &quot;rules&quot; how CUPS
recognizes MIME types. The file
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.convs</tt> decides which file
conversion filter(s) may be applied to which MIME types.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2928581"></a>PostScript Printer Descriptions (PPDs) for non-PS Printers</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2928590"></a><p>
Originally PPDs were meant to be used for PostScript printers
only. Here, they help to send device-specific commands and settings
to the RIP which processes the jobfile. CUPS has extended this
scope for PPDs to cover non-PostScript printers too. This was not
very difficult, because it is a standardized file format. In a way
it was logical too: CUPS handles PostScript and uses a PostScript
RIP (=Ghostscript) to process the jobfiles. The only difference is:
a PostScript printer has the RIP built-in, for other types of
printers the Ghostscript RIP runs on the host computer.
</p><p>
PPDs for a non-PS printer have a few lines that are unique to
CUPS. The most important one looks similar to this:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2928619"></a><pre class="screen">
 *cupsFilter: application/vnd.cups-raster  66   rastertoprinter
</pre><p>
It is the last piece in the CUPS filtering puzzle. This line tells the
CUPS daemon to use as a last filter &quot;rastertoprinter&quot;.  This filter
should be served as input an &quot;application/vnd.cups-raster&quot; MIME type
file. Therefore CUPS should auto-construct a filtering chain, which
delivers as its last output the specified MIME type. This is then
taken as input to the specified &quot;rastertoprinter&quot; filter. After this
the last filter has done its work (&quot;rastertoprinter&quot; is a Gimp-Print
filter), the file should go to the backend, which sends it to the
output device.
</p><p>
CUPS by default ships only a few generic PPDs, but they are good for
several hundred printer models. You may not be able to control
different paper trays, or you may get larger margins than your
specific model supports):

Native CUPS rasterization works in two steps.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
First is the &quot;pstoraster&quot; step. It uses the special &quot;cups&quot;
<a class="indexterm" name="id2928898"></a>
device from ESP Ghostscript 7.05.x as its tool
</p></li><li><p>
Second comes the &quot;rasterdriver&quot; step. It uses various
device-specific filters; there are several vendors who provide good
quality filters for this step, some are Free Software, some are
Shareware/Non-Free, some are proprietary.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Often this produces better quality (and has several more
advantages) than other methods.
</p><p>
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="small10"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.10. cupsomatic/foomatic processing versus Native CUPS</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/10small.png" width="270" alt="cupsomatic/foomatic processing versus Native CUPS"></div></div><p>
</p><p>
One other method is the <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsomatic/foomatic-rip</em></span>
way. Note that cupsomatic is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> made by the CUPS
developers. It is an independent contribution to printing development,
made by people from Linuxprinting.org (see also <a href="http://www.cups.org/cups-help.html" target="_top">http://www.cups.org/cups-help.html</a>).
cupsomatic is no longer developed and maintained and is no longer
supported. It has now been replaced by
<span class="emphasis"><em>foomatic-rip</em></span>. foomatic-rip is a complete re-write
of the old cupsomatic idea, but very much improved and generalized to
other (non-CUPS) spoolers. An upgrade to foomatic-rip is strongly
advised, especially if you are upgrading to a recent version of CUPS
too.
</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2929012"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2929021"></a>
Both the cupsomatic (old) and the foomatic-rip (new) methods from
Linuxprinting.org use the traditional Ghostscript print file
processing, doing everything in a single step. It therefore relies on
all the other devices built-in into Ghostscript. The quality is as
good (or bad) as Ghostscript rendering is in other spoolers. The
advantage is that this method supports many printer models not
supported (yet) by the more modern CUPS method.
</p><p>
Of course, you can use both methods side by side on one system (and
even for one printer, if you set up different queues), and find out
which works best for you.
</p><p>
cupsomatic &quot;kidnaps&quot; the printfile after the
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span> stage and
deviates it through the CUPS-external, system wide Ghostscript
installation: Therefore the printfile bypasses the &quot;pstoraster&quot; filter
(and thus also bypasses the CUPS-raster-drivers
&quot;rastertosomething&quot;). After Ghostscript finished its rasterization,
cupsomatic hands the rendered file directly to the CUPS backend. The
flowchart above illustrates the difference between native CUPS
rendering and the Foomatic/cupsomatic method.

Here are a few examples of commonly occurring filtering chains to
illustrate the workings of CUPS.
</p><p>
Assume you want to print a PDF file to a HP JetDirect-connected
PostScript printer, but you want to print the pages 3-5, 7, 11-13
only, and you want to print them &quot;2-up&quot; and &quot;duplex&quot;:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>your print options (page selection as required, 2-up,
duplex) are passed to CUPS on the commandline;</p></li><li><p>the (complete) PDF file is sent to CUPS and autotyped as
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/pdf</em></span>;</p></li><li><p>the file therefore first must pass the
<span class="emphasis"><em>pdftops</em></span> pre-filter, which produces PostScript
MIME type <span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span> (a preview here
would still show all pages of the original PDF);</p></li><li><p>the file then passes the <span class="emphasis"><em>pstops</em></span>
filter which applies the commandline options: it selects the pages
2-5, 7 and 11-13, creates and imposed layout &quot;2 pages on 1 sheet&quot; and
inserts the correct &quot;duplex&quot; command (as is defined in the printer's
PPD) into the new PostScript file; the file now is of PostScript MIME
type
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span>;</p></li><li><p>the file goes to the <span class="emphasis"><em>socket</em></span>
backend, which transfers the job to the printers.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	The resulting filter chain therefore is as drawn in <a href="CUPS-printing.html#pdftosocket" title="Figure 19.11. PDF to socket chain">the image below</a>.
</p><div class="figure"><a name="pdftosocket"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.11. PDF to socket chain</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/pdftosocket.png" width="270" alt="PDF to socket chain"></div></div><p>
Assume your want to print the same filter to an USB-connected
Epson Stylus Photo printer, installed with the CUPS
<tt class="filename">stphoto2.ppd</tt>. The first few filtering stages
are nearly the same:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>your print options (page selection as required, 2-up,

the commandline options: it selects the pages 2-5, 7 and 11-13,
creates and imposed layout &quot;2 pages on 1 sheet&quot; and inserts the
correct &quot;duplex&quot; command... (OOoops -- this printer and his PPD
don't support duplex printing at all -- this option will be ignored
then) into the new PostScript file; the file now is of PostScript
MIME type 
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/vnd.cups-postscript</em></span>;</p></li><li><p>the file then passes the
<span class="emphasis"><em>pstoraster</em></span> stage and becomes MIME type
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/cups-raster</em></span>;</p></li><li><p>finally, the <span class="emphasis"><em>rastertoepson</em></span> filter
does its work (as is indicated in the printer's PPD), creating the
printer-specific raster data and embedding any user-selected
print-options into the print data stream;</p></li><li><p>the file goes to the <span class="emphasis"><em>usb</em></span> backend,
which transfers the job to the printers.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	The resulting filter chain therefore is as drawn in <a href="CUPS-printing.html#pdftoepsonusb" title="Figure 19.12. PDF to USB chain">the image below</a>.

CUPS also supports the usage of &quot;interface scripts&quot; as known from
System V AT&amp;T printing systems. These are often used for PCL
printers, from applications that generate PCL print jobs.  Interface
scripts are specific to printer models. They have a similar role as
PPDs for PostScript printers. Interface scripts may inject the Escape
sequences as required into the print data stream, if the user has
chosen to select a certain paper tray, or print landscape, or use A3
paper, etc. Interfaces scripts are practically unknown in the Linux
realm. On HP-UX platforms they are more often used. You can use any
working interface script on CUPS too. Just install the printer with
the <b class="command">-i</b> option:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -p pclprinter -v socket://11.12.13.14:9100 \
  -i /path/to/interface-script</tt></b>
</pre><p>
Interface scripts might be the &quot;unknown animal&quot; to many.  However,
with CUPS they provide the most easy way to plug in your own
custom-written filtering script or program into one specific print
queue (some information about the traditional usage of interface scripts is
to be found at <a href="http://playground.sun.com/printing/documentation/interface.html" target="_top">http://playground.sun.com/printing/documentation/interface.html</a>).
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2929667"></a>Network printing (purely Windows)</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Network printing covers a lot of ground. To understand what exactly
goes on with Samba when it is printing on behalf of its Windows
clients, let's first look at a &quot;purely Windows&quot; setup: Windows clients
with a Windows NT print server.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2929677"></a>From Windows Clients to an NT Print Server</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Windows clients printing to an NT-based print server have two
options. They may
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2929699"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2929707"></a><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>execute the driver locally and render the GDI output
(EMF) into the printer specific format on their own,
or</p></li><li><p>send the GDI output (EMF) to the server, where the
driver is executed to render the printer specific
output.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Both print paths are shown in the flowcharts below.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2929741"></a>Driver Execution on the Client</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
In the first case the print server must spool the file as &quot;raw&quot;,
meaning it shouldn't touch the jobfile and try to convert it in any
way. This is what traditional UNIX-based print server can do too; and
at a better performance and more reliably than NT print server. This
is what most Samba administrators probably are familiar with. One
advantage of this setup is that this &quot;spooling-only&quot; print server may
be used even if no driver(s) for UNIX are available it is sufficient
to have the Windows client drivers available and installed on the

The other path executes the printer driver on the server. The clients
transfers print files in EMF format to the server. The server uses the
PostScript, PCL, ESC/P or other driver to convert the EMF file into
the printer-specific language. It is not possible for UNIX to do the
same. Currently there is no program or method to convert a Windows
client's GDI output on a UNIX server into something a printer could
understand.

However, there is something similar possible with CUPS. Read on...
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2929936"></a>Network Printing (Windows clients -- UNIX/Samba Print
Servers)</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Since UNIX print servers <span class="emphasis"><em>cannot</em></span> execute the Win32
program code on their platform, the picture is somewhat
different. However, this doesn't limit your options all that
much. In the contrary, you may have a way here to implement printing
features which are not possible otherwise.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2929956"></a>From Windows Clients to a CUPS/Samba Print Server</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Here is a simple recipe showing how you can take advantage of CUPS
powerful features for the benefit of your Windows network printing
clients:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Let the Windows clients send PostScript to the CUPS
server.</p></li><li><p>Let the CUPS server render the PostScript into device
specific raster format.</p></li></ul></div><p>
This requires the clients to use a PostScript driver (even if the
printer is a non-PostScript model. It also requires that you have a
&quot;driver&quot; on the CUPS server.
</p><p>
Firstly, to enable CUPS based printing through Samba the
following options should be set in your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file [global]
section:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2930017"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = cups</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2930035"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printcap</tt></i> = cups</p></li></ul></div><p>
When these parameters are specified, all manually set print directives
(like <a class="indexterm" name="id2930055"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>print command</tt></i>, or <a class="indexterm" name="id2930069"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>lppause command</tt></i>) in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> (as well as
in samba itself) will be ignored. Instead, Samba will directly
interface with CUPS through it's application program interface (API) -
as long as Samba has been compiled with CUPS library (libcups)
support. If Samba has NOT been compiled with CUPS support, and if no
other print commands are set up, then printing will use the
<span class="emphasis"><em>System V</em></span> AT&amp;T command set, with the -oraw
option automatically passing through (if you want your own defined
print commands to work with a Samba that has CUPS support compiled in,
simply use <a class="indexterm" name="id2930107"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printing</tt></i> = sysv).
</p><p>
</p><div class="figure"><a name="small13"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.15. Printing via CUPS/samba server</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="projdoc/imagefiles/13small.png" width="270" alt="Printing via CUPS/samba server"></div></div><p>
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930169"></a>Samba receiving Jobfiles and passing them to CUPS</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Samba <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> use its own spool directory (it is set
by a line similar to <a class="indexterm" name="id2930184"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>path</tt></i> = /var/spool/samba,
in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[printers]</tt></i> or
<i class="parameter"><tt>[printername]</tt></i> section of
<tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>). Samba receives the job in its own
spool space and passes it into the spool directory of CUPS (the CUPS
spooling directory is set by the <i class="parameter"><tt>RequestRoot</tt></i>
directive, in a line that defaults to <i class="parameter"><tt>RequestRoot
/var/spool/cups</tt></i>).  CUPS checks the access rights of its
spool dir and resets it to healthy values with every re-start. We have
seen quite some people who had used a common spooling space for Samba
and CUPS, and were struggling for weeks with this &quot;problem&quot;.
</p><p>
A Windows user authenticates only to Samba (by whatever means is
configured). If Samba runs on the same host as CUPS, you only need to
allow &quot;localhost&quot; to print. If they run on different machines, you
need to make sure the Samba host gets access to printing on CUPS.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2930255"></a>Network PostScript RIP: CUPS Filters on Server -- clients use
PostScript Driver with CUPS-PPDs</h2></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2930265"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2930273"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2930282"></a><p>
PPDs can control all print device options. They are usually provided
by the manufacturer; if you own a PostScript printer, that is. PPD
files (PostScript Printer Descriptions) are always a component of
PostScript printer drivers on MS Windows or Apple Mac OS systems. They
are ASCII files containing user-selectable print options, mapped to
appropriate PostScript, PCL or PJL commands for the target
printer. Printer driver GUI dialogs translate these options
&quot;on-the-fly&quot; into buttons and drop-down lists for the user to select.
</p><p>
CUPS can load, without any conversions, the PPD file from any Windows
(NT is recommended) PostScript driver and handle the options. There is
a web browser interface to the print options (select <a href="http://localhost:631/printers/" target="_top">http://localhost:631/printers/</a>
and click on one <span class="emphasis"><em>Configure Printer</em></span> button to see
it), or a commandline interface (see <b class="command">man lpoptions</b>
or see if you have lphelp on your system). There are also some
different GUI frontends on Linux/UNIX, which can present PPD options
to users. PPD options are normally meant to be evaluated by the
PostScript RIP on the real PostScript printer.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930344"></a>PPDs for non-PS Printers on UNIX</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2930352"></a><p>
CUPS doesn't limit itself to &quot;real&quot; PostScript printers in its usage
of PPDs. The CUPS developers have extended the scope of the PPD
concept, to also describe available device and driver options for
non-PostScript printers through CUPS-PPDs.
</p><p>
This is logical, as CUPS includes a fully featured PostScript
interpreter (RIP). This RIP is based on Ghostscript. It can process
all received PostScript (and additionally many other file formats)
from clients. All CUPS-PPDs geared to non-PostScript printers contain
an additional line, starting with the keyword
<i class="parameter"><tt>*cupsFilter</tt></i> . This line tells the CUPS print
system which printer-specific filter to use for the interpretation of
the supplied PostScript. Thus CUPS lets all its printers appear as
PostScript devices to its clients, because it can act as a PostScript
RIP for those printers, processing the received PostScript code into a
proper raster print format.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930400"></a>PPDs for non-PS Printers on Windows</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2930408"></a><p>
CUPS-PPDs can also be used on Windows-Clients, on top of a
&quot;core&quot; PostScript driver (now recommended is the &quot;CUPS PostScript
Driver for WindowsNT/2K/XP&quot;; you can also use the Adobe one, with
limitations). This feature enables CUPS to do a few tricks no other
spooler can do:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>act as a networked PostScript RIP (Raster Image
Processor), handling printfiles from all client platforms in a uniform
way;</p></li><li><p>act as a central accounting and billing server, since
all files are passed through the pstops filter and are therefore
logged in the CUPS <tt class="filename">page_log</tt> file.
<span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE:</em></span> this can not happen with &quot;raw&quot; print jobs,
which always remain unfiltered per definition;</p></li><li><p>enable clients to consolidate on a single PostScript
driver, even for many different target printers.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Using CUPS PPDs on Windows clients enables these to control
all print job settings just as a UNIX client can do too.
</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2930476"></a>Windows Terminal Servers (WTS) as CUPS Clients</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
This setup may be of special interest to people experiencing major
problems in WTS environments. WTS need often a multitude of
non-PostScript drivers installed to run their clients' variety of
different printer models. This often imposes the price of much
increased instability.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930493"></a>Printer Drivers running in &quot;Kernel Mode&quot; cause many
Problems</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The reason is that in Win NT printer drivers run in &quot;Kernel
Mode&quot;, this introduces a high risk for the stability of the system
if the driver is not really stable and well-tested. And there are a
lot of bad drivers out there! Especially notorious is the example
of the PCL printer driver that had an additional sound module
running, to notify users via soundcard of their finished jobs. Do I
need to say that this one was also reliably causing &quot;Blue Screens
of Death&quot; on a regular basis?
</p><p>
PostScript drivers generally are very well tested. They are not known
to cause any problems, even though they run in Kernel Mode too. This
might be because there have so far only been 2 different PostScript
drivers: the ones from Adobe and the one from Microsoft. Both are
very well tested and are as stable as you ever can imagine on
Windows. The CUPS driver is derived from the Microsoft one.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930538"></a>Workarounds impose Heavy Limitations</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
In many cases, in an attempt to work around this problem, site
administrators have resorted to restrict the allowed drivers installed
on their WTS to one generic PCL- and one PostScript driver. This
however restricts the clients in the amount of printer options
available for them; often they can't get out more than simplex
prints from one standard paper tray, while their devices could do much
better, if driven by a different driver! )
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930560"></a>CUPS: a &quot;Magical Stone&quot;?</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2930569"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2930577"></a><p>
Using a PostScript driver, enabled with a CUPS-PPD, seems to be a very
elegant way to overcome all these shortcomings. There are, depending
on the version of Windows OS you use, up to 3 different PostScript
drivers available: Adobe, Microsoft and CUPS PostScript drivers. None
of them is known to cause major stability problems on WTS (even if
used with many different PPDs). The clients will be able to (again)
chose paper trays, duplex printing and other settings. However, there
is a certain price for this too: a CUPS server acting as a PostScript
RIP for its clients requires more CPU and RAM than when just acting as
a &quot;raw spooling&quot; device.  Plus, this setup is not yet widely tested,
although the first feedbacks look very promising.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2930614"></a>PostScript Drivers with no major problems -- even in Kernel
Mode</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2930623"></a><p>
More recent printer drivers on W2K and XP don't run in Kernel mode
(unlike Win NT) any more. However, both operating systems can still
use the NT drivers, running in Kernel mode (you can roughly tell which
is which as the drivers in subdirectory &quot;2&quot; of &quot;W32X86&quot; are &quot;old&quot;
ones).  As was said before, the Adobe as well as the Microsoft
PostScript drivers are not known to cause any stability problems. The
CUPS driver is derived from the Microsoft one. There is a simple
reason for this: The MS DDK (Device Development Kit) for Win NT (which
used to be available at no cost to licensees of Visual Studio)
includes the source code of the Microsoft driver, and licensees of
Visual Studio are allowed to use and modify it for their own driver
development efforts. This is what the CUPS people have done. The
license doesn't allow them to publish the whole of the source code.
However, they have released the &quot;diff&quot; under the GPL, and if you are
owner of an &quot;MS DDK for Win NT&quot;, you can check the driver yourself.

As we have said before: all previously known methods to prepare client
printer drivers on the Samba server for download and &quot;Point'n'Print&quot;
convenience of Windows workstations are working with CUPS too. These
methods were described in the previous chapter. In reality, this is a
pure Samba business, and only relates to the Samba/Win client
relationship.

The cupsaddsmb utility (shipped with all current CUPS versions) is an
alternative method to transfer printer drivers into the Samba
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share. Remember, this share is where
clients expect drivers deposited and setup for download and
installation.  It makes the sharing of any (or all) installed CUPS
printers very easy. cupsaddsmb can use the Adobe PostScript driver as
well as the newly developed <span class="emphasis"><em>CUPS PostScript Driver for
WinNT/2K/XP</em></span>. Note, that cupsaddsmb does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> work with arbitrary vendor printer drivers,
but only with the <span class="emphasis"><em>exact</em></span> driver files that are
named in its man page.
</p><p>
The CUPS printer driver is available from the CUPS download site. Its
package name is <tt class="filename">cups-samba-[version].tar.gz</tt> . It
is preferred over the Adobe drivers since it has a number of
advantages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>it supports a much more accurate page
accounting;</p></li><li><p>it supports banner pages, and page labels on all
printers;</p></li><li><p>it supports the setting of a number of job IPP
attributes (such as job-priority, page-label and
job-billing)</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, currently only Windows NT, 2000, and XP are supported by the
CUPS drivers. You will need to get the respective part of Adobe driver
too if you need to support Windows 95, 98, and ME clients.

CUPS users may get the exactly same packages from <a href="http://www.cups.org/software.html" target="_top">http://www.cups.org/software.html</a>.
It is a separate package from the CUPS base software files, tagged as
<span class="emphasis"><em>CUPS 1.1.x Windows NT/2k/XP Printer Driver for Samba

This new CUPS PostScript driver is currently binary-only, but free of
charge. No complete source code is provided (yet). The reason is this:
it has been developed with the help of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Microsoft Driver
Developer Kit</em></span> (DDK) and compiled with Microsoft Visual
Studio 6. Driver developers are not allowed to distribute the whole of
the source code as Free Software. However, CUPS developers released
the &quot;diff&quot; in source code under the GPL, so anybody with a license of
Visual Studio and a DDK will be able to compile for him/herself.

Acquiring the Adobe driver files seems to be unexpectedly difficult
for many users. They are not available on the Adobe website as single
files and the self-extracting and/or self-installing Windows-exe is
not easy to locate either. Probably you need to use the included
native installer and run the installation process on one client
once. This will install the drivers (and one Generic PostScript
printer) locally on the client.  When they are installed, share the
Generic PostScript printer.  After this, the client's
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share holds the Adobe files, from
where you can get them with smbclient from the CUPS host. A more
detailed description about this is in the next (the CUPS printing)
chapter.

Users of the ESP Print Pro software are able to install their &quot;Samba

files from the normal download area of the ESP Print Pro software
at <a href="http://www.easysw.com/software.html" target="_top">http://www.easysw.com/software.html</a>.
You need to locate the link labelled &quot;SAMBA&quot; amongst the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Download Printer Drivers for ESP Print Pro 4.x</em></span>
area and download the package. Once installed, you can prepare any
driver by simply highlighting the printer in the Printer Manager GUI
and select <span class="emphasis"><em>Export Driver...</em></span> from the menu. Of
course you need to have prepared Samba beforehand too to handle the
driver files; i.e.  mainly setup the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>
share, etc. The ESP Print Pro package includes the CUPS driver files
as well as a (licensed) set of Adobe drivers for the Windows 95/98/ME
client family.

Should your Win clients have had the old <tt class="filename">ADOBE*.*</tt>
files for the Adobe PostScript driver installed, the download and
installation of the new CUPS PostScript driver for Windows NT/2k/XP
will fail at first. You need to wipe the old driver from the clients
first. It is not enough to &quot;delete&quot; the printer, as the driver files
will still be kept by the clients and re-used if you try to re-install
the printer. To really get rid of the Adobe driver files on the
clients, open the &quot;Printers&quot; folder (possibly via <span class="emphasis"><em>Start, Settings, Control Panel, Printers</em></span>),
right-click onto the folder background and select <span class="emphasis"><em>Server
Properties</em></span>. When the new dialog opens, select the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Drivers</em></span> tab. On the list select the driver you
want to delete and click on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Delete</em></span>
button. This will only work if there is not one single printer left
which uses that particular driver. You need to &quot;delete&quot; all printers
using this driver in the &quot;Printers&quot; folder first. You will need
Administrator privileges to do this.
</p></li><li><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2931795"></a>
Once you have successfully downloaded the CUPS PostScript driver to a
client, you can easily switch all printers to this one by proceeding
as described in <a href="printing.html" title="Chapter 18. Classical Printing Support">the printing chapter</a>: either change
a driver for an existing printer by running the &quot;Printer Properties&quot;
dialog, or use <b class="command">rpcclient</b> with the

Windows NT/2k/XP&quot; instead of Adobe Driver</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
You are interested in a comparison between the CUPS and the Adobe
PostScript drivers? For our purposes these are the most important
items which weigh in favor of the CUPS ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>no hassle with the Adobe EULA</p></li><li><p>no hassle with the question &#8220;<span class="quote">Where do I
get the ADOBE*.* driver files from?</span>&#8221;</p></li><li><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2931878"></a>
		the Adobe drivers (on request of the printer PPD
associated with them) often put a PJL header in front of the main
PostScript part of the print file. Thus the printfile starts with
<i class="parameter"><tt>&lt;1B &gt;%-12345X</tt></i> or
<i class="parameter"><tt>&lt;escape&gt;%-12345X</tt></i> instead
of <i class="parameter"><tt>%!PS</tt></i>). This leads to the
CUPS daemon auto-typing the incoming file as a print-ready file,
not initiating a pass through the &quot;pstops&quot; filter (to speak more
technically, it is not regarded as the generic MIME type 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2931916"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span>, but as
the more special MIME type
<a class="indexterm" name="id2931930"></a>
<span class="emphasis"><em>application/cups.vnd-postscript</em></span>),
which therefore also leads to the page accounting in
<span class="emphasis"><em>/var/log/cups/page_log</em></span> not
receiving the exact number of pages; instead the dummy page number
of &quot;1&quot; is logged in a standard setup)</p></li><li><p>the Adobe driver has more options to &quot;mis-configure&quot; the
PostScript generated by it (like setting it inadvertently to
<span class="emphasis"><em>Optimize for Speed</em></span>, instead of
<span class="emphasis"><em>Optimize for Portability</em></span>, which
could lead to CUPS being unable to process it)</p></li><li><p>the CUPS PostScript driver output sent by Windows
clients to the CUPS server will be guaranteed to be auto-typed always
as generic MIME type <span class="emphasis"><em>application/postscript</em></span>,
thusly passing through the CUPS &quot;pstops&quot; filter and logging the
correct number of pages in the <tt class="filename">page_log</tt> for
accounting and quota purposes</p></li><li><p>the CUPS PostScript driver supports the sending of
additional standard (IPP) print options by Win NT/2k/XP clients.  Such
additional print options are: naming the CUPS standard
<span class="emphasis"><em>banner pages</em></span> (or the custom ones, should they be
installed at the time of driver download), using the CUPS
<span class="emphasis"><em>page-label</em></span> option, setting a
<span class="emphasis"><em>job-priority</em></span> and setting the <span class="emphasis"><em>scheduled
time of printing</em></span> (with the option to support additional
useful IPP job attributes in the future).</p></li><li><p>the CUPS PostScript driver supports the inclusion of
the new <span class="emphasis"><em>*cupsJobTicket</em></span> comments at the
beginning of the PostScript file (which could be used in the future
for all sort of beneficial extensions on the CUPS side, but which will
not disturb any other applications as they will regard it as a comment
and simply ignore it).</p></li><li><p>the CUPS PostScript driver will be the heart of the
fully fledged CUPS IPP client for Windows NT/2K/XP to be released soon
(probably alongside the first Beta release for CUPS
1.2).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2932052"></a>Run &quot;cupsaddsmb&quot; (quiet Mode)</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2932062"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2932070"></a><p>
The cupsaddsmb command copies the needed files into your
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share. Additionally, the PPD
associated with this printer is copied from
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/ppd/</tt> to
<i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i>. There the files wait for convenient
Windows client installations via Point'n'Print. Before we can run the
command successfully, we need to be sure that we can authenticate
towards Samba. If you have a small network you are probably using user
level security (<a class="indexterm" name="id2932107"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>security</tt></i> = user). 
</p><p>
Here is an example of a successfully run cupsaddsmb command.

To share <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> printers and drivers, use the

cupsaddsmb &quot;exports&quot; the printer drivers to Samba, it should be
obvious that it only works for queues with a CUPS driver associated.

If you look closely, you'll discover your root password was transferred
unencrypted over the wire, so beware! Also, if you look further her,
you'll discover error messages like NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_COLLISION in
between. They occur, because the directories WIN40 and W32X86 already
existed in the <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> driver download share
(from a previous driver installation). They are harmless here.

What has happened? What did cupsaddsmb do? There are five stages of
the procedure
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2932438"></a>
			call the CUPS server via IPP and request the

 <i class="parameter"><tt>[print$]</tt></i> share and put the files into the
 share's WIN40 (for Win95/98/ME) and W32X86/ (for WinNT/2k/XP) sub
 directories;</p></li><li><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2932482"></a>
		connect via rpcclient to the Samba server and

<a class="indexterm" name="id2932501"></a>
		connect via rpcclient to the Samba server a second
time and execute the &quot;setdriver&quot; command.</p></li></ol></div><p>
Note, that you can run the cupsaddsmb utility with parameters to
specify one remote host as Samba host and a second remote host as CUPS
host. Especially if you want to get a deeper understanding, it is a
good idea try it and see more clearly what is going on (though in real
life most people will have their CUPS and Samba servers run on the
same host):
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>cupsaddsmb -H sambaserver -h cupsserver -v printername</tt></b>
</pre></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2932551"></a>How to recognize if cupsaddsmb completed successfully</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
You <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> always check if the utility completed
successfully in all fields. You need as a minimum these 3 messages
amongst the output:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Printer Driver infotec_2105 successfully
installed.</em></span> # (for the W32X86 == WinNT/2K/XP

architecture...)</p></li><li><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Successfully set [printerXPZ] to driver
[printerXYZ].</em></span></p></li></ol></div><p>
These messages probably not easily recognized in the general
output. If you run cupsaddsmb with the <tt class="option">-a</tt>
parameter (which tries to prepare <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> active CUPS
printer drivers for download), you might miss if individual printers
drivers had problems to install properly. Here a redirection of the
output will help you analyze the results in retrospective.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
It is impossible to see any diagnostic output if you don't run
cupsaddsmb in verbose mode.  Therefore we strongly recommend to not
use the default quiet mode.  It will hide any problems from you which
might occur.

After cupsaddsmb completed, your driver is prepared for the clients to
use. Here are the steps you must perform to download and install it
via &quot;Point'n'Print&quot;. From a Windows client, browse to the CUPS/Samba
server;
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><a class="indexterm" name="id2932816"></a><ul type="disc"><li><p>open the <span class="emphasis"><em>Printers</em></span>

<span class="emphasis"><em>Install...</em></span> or 
<span class="emphasis"><em>Connect...</em></span> (depending on the Windows version you
use).</p></li></ul></div><p>
After a few seconds, there should be a new printer in your
client's <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> &quot;Printers&quot; folder: On Windows
XP it will follow a naming convention of <span class="emphasis"><em>PrinterName on
SambaServer</em></span>. (In my current case it is &quot;infotec_2105 on
kde-bitshop&quot;). If you want to test it and send your first job from
an application like Winword, the new printer will appears in a
<tt class="filename">\\SambaServer\PrinterName</tt> entry in the
dropdown list of available printers.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
<a class="indexterm" name="id2932893"></a>
cupsaddsmb will only reliably work with CUPS version 1.1.15 or higher
and Samba from 2.2.4. If it doesn't work, or if the automatic printer
driver download to the clients doesn't succeed, you can still manually
install the CUPS printer PPD on top of the Adobe PostScript driver on
clients. Then point the client's printer queue to the Samba printer
share for a UNC type of connection:
</p></div><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">C:\&gt; </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>net use lpt1: \\sambaserver\printershare /user:ntadmin</tt></b>
</pre><p>
should you desire to use the CUPS networked PostScript RIP
functions. (Note that user &quot;ntadmin&quot; needs to be a valid Samba user
with the required privileges to access the printershare) This would
set up the printer connection in the traditional
<span class="emphasis"><em>LanMan</em></span> way (not using MS-RPC).

Soooo: printing works, but there are still problems. Most jobs print
well, some don't print at all. Some jobs have problems with fonts,
which don't look very good. Some jobs print fast, and some are
dead-slow. Many of these problems can be greatly reduced or even
completely eliminated if you follow a few guidelines. Remember, if
your print device is not PostScript-enabled, you are treating your

<b class="command">enumdrivers</b>, <b class="command">enumports</b>,
<b class="command">adddriver</b>, <b class="command">setdriver</b> are amongst
the most interesting ones. rpcclient implements an important part of
the MS-RPC protocol. You can use it to query (and command) a Win NT
(or 2K/XP) PC too. MS-RPC is used by Windows clients, amongst other
things, to benefit from the &quot;Point'n'Print&quot; features. Samba can now
mimic this too.

First let's have a little check of the rpcclient man page. Here are
two relevant passages:
</p><p>
<b class="command">adddriver &lt;arch&gt; &lt;config&gt;</b> Execute an
AddPrinterDriver() RPC to install the printer driver information on
the server.  Note that the driver files should already exist in the
directory returned by <b class="command">getdriverdir</b>.  Possible
values for <i class="parameter"><tt>arch</tt></i> are the same as those for the
<b class="command">getdriverdir</b> command.  The
<i class="parameter"><tt>config</tt></i> parameter is defined as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
Long Printer Name:\
Driver File Name:\
Data File Name:\
Config File Name:\
Help File Name:\
Language Monitor Name:\
Default Data Type:\
Comma Separated list of Files
</pre><p>Any empty fields should be enter as the string &quot;NULL&quot;. </p><p>Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors
since these only apply to local printers whose driver can make use of
a bi-directional link for communication.  This field should be &quot;NULL&quot;.
On a remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a driver must
already be installed prior to adding the driver or else the RPC will
fail
</p><p>
<b class="command">setdriver &lt;printername&gt; &lt;drivername&gt;</b>
Execute a <b class="command">SetPrinter()</b> command to update the
printer driver associated with an installed printer. The printer
driver must already be correctly installed on the print server.
</p><p> See also the enumprinters and enumdrivers commands for
obtaining a list of installed printers and drivers.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2933403"></a>Understanding the rpcclient man page</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>exact</em></span> format isn't made too clear by the man
page, since you have to deal with some parameters containing
spaces. Here is a better description for it. We have line-broken the
command and indicated the breaks with &quot;\&quot;. Usually you would type the
command in one line without the linebreaks:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2933427"></a><pre class="screen">
 adddriver &quot;Architecture&quot; \
           &quot;LongPrinterName:DriverFile:DataFile:ConfigFile:HelpFile:\
           LanguageMonitorFile:DataType:ListOfFiles,Comma-separated&quot;
</pre><p>
What the man pages denotes as a simple &lt;config&gt;
keyword, does in reality consist of 8 colon-separated fields. The
last field may take multiple (in some, very insane, cases, even
20 different additional files. This might sound confusing at first.
Note, that what the man pages names the &quot;LongPrinterName&quot; in
reality should rather be called the &quot;Driver Name&quot;. You can name it
anything you want, as long as you use this name later in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>rpcclient ... setdriver</em></span> command. For
practical reasons, many name the driver the same as the
printer.
</p><p>
True: it isn't simple at all. I hear you asking:
<span class="emphasis"><em>How do I know which files are &quot;Driver
File&quot;, &quot;Data File&quot;, &quot;Config File&quot;, &quot;Help File&quot; and &quot;Language
Monitor File&quot; in each case?</em></span> -- For an answer you may
want to have a look at how a Windows NT box with a shared printer
presents the files to us. Remember, that this whole procedure has
to be developed by the Samba Team by overhearing the traffic caused
by Windows computers on the wire. We may as well turn to a Windows
box now, and access it from a UNIX workstation. We will query it
with <b class="command">rpcclient</b> to see what it tells us and
try to understand the man page more clearly which we've read just
now.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2933506"></a>Producing an Example by querying a Windows Box</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2933518"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2933528"></a>
We could run <b class="command">rpcclient</b> with a
<b class="command">getdriver</b> or a <b class="command">getprinter</b>
subcommand (in level 3 verbosity) against it. Just sit down at UNIX or
Linux workstation with the Samba utilities installed. Then type the
following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient -U'USERNAME%PASSWORD' NT-SERVER-NAME -c 'getdriver printername 3'</tt></b>
</pre><p>
From the result it should become clear which is which. Here is an
example from my installation:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2933591"></a><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient -U'Danka%xxxx' W2KSERVER \

Some printer drivers list additional files under the label
&quot;Dependentfiles&quot;: these would go into the last field
<span class="emphasis"><em>ListOfFiles,Comma-separated</em></span>. For the CUPS
PostScript drivers we don't need any (nor would we for the Adobe

From the manpage (and from the quoted output
of <span class="emphasis"><em>cupsaddsmb</em></span>, above) it becomes clear that you
need to have certain conditions in order to make the manual uploading
and initializing of the driver files succeed. The two rpcclient
<a class="indexterm" name="id2933693"></a>
subcommands (<b class="command">adddriver</b> and
<b class="command">setdriver</b>) need to encounter the following
pre-conditions to complete successfully:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>you are connected as <a class="indexterm" name="id2933728"></a><i class="parameter"><tt>printer admin</tt></i>, or root (note,

<span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> put them there, they'll be automatically
used by the <b class="command">adddriver</b> subcommand.! (if you use
&quot;smbclient&quot; to put the driver files into the share, note that you need
to escape the &quot;$&quot;: <b class="command">smbclient //sambaserver/print\$ -U

		the CUPS printer must be known to Samba, otherwise the
<b class="command">setdriver</b> subcommand fails with an
NT_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL error. To check if the printer is known by
Samba you may use the <b class="command">enumprinters</b> subcommand to
rpcclient. A long-standing bug prevented a proper update of the
printer list until every smbd process had received a SIGHUP or was
restarted. Remember this in case you've created the CUPS printer just
shortly ago and encounter problems: try restarting
Samba.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2933889"></a>Manual Driver Installation in 15 Steps</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>

Note that your cannot repeat this step if it fails. It could fail even
as a result of a simple typo. It will most likely have moved a part of
the driver files into the &quot;2&quot; subdirectory. If this step fails, you
need to go back to the fourth step and repeat it, before you can try
this one again. In this step you need to choose a name for your
driver. It is normally a good idea to use the same name as is used for
the printername; however, in big installations you may use this driver
for a number of printers which have obviously different names. So the
name of the driver is not fixed.

Compare these results with the ones from steps 2 and 3. Note that

You certainly know how to install the driver on the client.  In case
you are not particularly familiar with Windows, here is a short
recipe: browse the Network Neighbourhood, go to the Samba server, look
for the shares. You should see all shared Samba printers.
Double-click on the one in question. The driver should get
installed, and the network connection set up. An alternative way is to
open the &quot;Printers (and Faxes)&quot; folder, right-click on the printer in
question and select &quot;Connect&quot; or &quot;Install&quot;. As a result, a new printer
should have appeared in your client's local &quot;Printers (and Faxes)&quot;
folder, named something like &quot;printersharename on Sambahostname&quot;.
</p><p>
It is important that you execute this step as a Samba printer admin
(as defined in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt>). Here is another method
to do this on Windows XP. It uses a commandline, which you may type
into the &quot;DOS box&quot; (type root's smbpassword when prompted):
</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>
Change any printer setting once (like changing <span class="emphasis"><em>&quot;portrait&quot; to
	&quot;landscape&quot;</em></span>), click <span class="guibutton">Apply</span>; change the setting
back.

the <b class="command">lpstat -p ir85wm</b> command. A
bug in most recent versions of Samba prevents the proper update of
the queuelist. The recognition of newly installed CUPS printers
fails unless you re-start Samba or send a HUP to all smbd
processes. To verify if this is the reason why Samba doesn't
execute the setdriver command successfully, check if Samba &quot;sees&quot;
the printer: 
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2935035"></a><pre class="screen">

        printername:[ir85wm]
</pre><p>
An alternative command could be this: 
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2935074"></a><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>rpcclient transmeta -N -U'root%secret' -c 'getprinter ir85wm' </tt></b>

BTW, you can use these commands, plus a few more, of course,
to install drivers on remote Windows NT print servers too!

Some mystery is associated with the series of files with a

<tt class="filename">connections.tdb</tt>,

<tt class="filename">share_info.tdb</tt> ,

A Windows NT (Print) Server keeps track of all information needed to serve
its duty toward its clients by storing entries in the Windows
&quot;Registry&quot;. Client queries are answered by reading from the registry,
Administrator or user configuration settings are saved by writing into
the Registry. Samba and UNIX obviously don't have such a kind of
Registry. Samba instead keeps track of all client related information in a
series of <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files. (TDB = Trivial Data
Base). These are often located in <tt class="filename">/var/lib/samba/</tt>
or <tt class="filename">/var/lock/samba/</tt> . The printing related files
are <tt class="filename">ntprinters.tdb</tt>,
<tt class="filename">printing.tdb</tt>,<tt class="filename">ntforms.tdb</tt> and
<tt class="filename">ntdrivers.tdb</tt>.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2935456"></a>Binary Format</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
<tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files are not human readable. They are
written in a binary format. &quot;Why not ASCII?&quot;, you may ask. &quot;After all,
ASCII configuration files are a good and proofed tradition on UNIX.&quot;
-- The reason for this design decision by the Samba Team is mainly
performance. Samba needs to be fast; it runs a separate
<b class="command">smbd</b> process for each client connection, in some
environments many thousand of them. Some of these smbds might need to
write-access the same <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> file <span class="emphasis"><em>at the
same time</em></span>. The file format of Samba's
<tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files allows for this provision. Many smbd
processes may write to the same <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> file at the
same time. This wouldn't be possible with pure ASCII files.

It is very important that all <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files remain
consistent over all write and read accesses. However, it may happen
that these files <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> get corrupted. (A
<b class="command">kill -9 `pidof smbd`</b> while a write access is in
progress could do the damage as well as a power interruption,
etc.). In cases of trouble, a deletion of the old printing-related
<tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files may be the only option. You need to
re-create all print related setup after that.  Or you have made a
backup of the <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files in time.

Samba ships with a little utility which helps the root user of your
system to back up your <tt class="filename">*.tdb</tt> files. If you run it
with no argument, it prints a little usage message:
</p><pre class="screen">

CUPS ships with good support for HP LaserJet type printers.  You can
install the generic driver as follows:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2935737"></a><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -p laserjet4plus -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E -m laserjet.ppd</tt></b>
</pre><p>
The <tt class="option">-m</tt> switch will retrieve the
<tt class="filename">laserjet.ppd</tt> from the standard repository for
not-yet-installed-PPDs, which CUPS typically stores in
<tt class="filename">/usr/share/cups/model</tt>. Alternatively, you may use
<tt class="option">-P /path/to/your.ppd</tt>.
</p><p>
The generic laserjet.ppd however does not support every special option
for every LaserJet-compatible model. It constitutes a sort of &quot;least
denominator&quot; of all the models. If for some reason it is ruled out to
you to pay for the commercially available ESP Print Pro drivers, your
first move should be to consult the database on <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi" target="_top">http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi</a>.
Linuxprinting.org has excellent recommendations about which driver is
best used for each printer. Its database is kept current by the
tireless work of Till Kamppeter from MandrakeSoft, who is also the
principal author of the foomatic-rip utility.

The former &quot;cupsomatic&quot; concept is now be replaced by the new, much
more powerful &quot;foomatic-rip&quot;. foomatic-rip is the successor of
cupsomatic. cupsomatic is no longer maintained. Here is the new URL
to the Foomatic-3.0 database:<a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/driver_list.cgi" target="_top">http://www.linuxprinting.org/driver_list.cgi</a>.
If you upgrade to foomatic-rip, don't forget to also upgrade to the
new-style PPDs for your foomatic-driven printers. foomatic-rip will
not work with PPDs generated for the old cupsomatic. The new-style
PPDs are 100% compliant to the Adobe PPD specification. They are
intended to be used by Samba and the cupsaddsmb utility also, to
provide the driver files for the Windows clients also!

Nowadays most Linux distros rely on the utilities of Linuxprinting.org
to create their printing related software (which, BTW, works on all
UNIXes and on Mac OS X or Darwin too). It is not known as well as it
should be, that it also has a very end-user friendly interface which
allows for an easy update of drivers and PPDs, for all supported
models, all spoolers, all operating systems and all package formats
(because there is none). Its history goes back a few years.
</p><p>
Recently Foomatic has achieved the astonishing milestone of <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Anyone" target="_top">1000
listed</a> printer models. Linuxprinting.org keeps all the
important facts about printer drivers, supported models and which
options are available for the various driver/printer combinations in
its <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html" target="_top">Foomatic</a>
database. Currently there are <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/driver_list.cgi" target="_top">245 drivers</a>
in the database: many drivers support various models, and many models
may be driven by different drivers; it's your choice!

At present there are 690 devices dubbed as working &quot;perfectly&quot;, 181
&quot;mostly&quot;, 96 &quot;partially&quot; and 46 are &quot;Paperweights&quot;. Keeping in mind
that most of these are non-PostScript models (PostScript printers are
automatically supported supported by CUPS to perfection, by using
their own manufacturer-provided Windows-PPD...), and that a
multifunctional device never qualifies as working &quot;perfectly&quot; if it
doesn't also scan and copy and fax under GNU/Linux: then this is a
truly astonishing achievement. Three years ago the number was not
more than 500, and Linux or UNIX &quot;printing&quot; at the time wasn't
anywhere near the quality it is today!

A few years ago <a href="http://www2.picante.com:81/~gtaylor/" target="_top">Grant Taylor</a>
started it all. The roots of today's Linuxprinting.org are in the
first <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/howto/" target="_top">Linux Printing
HOWTO</a> which he authored. As a side-project to this document,
which served many Linux users and admins to guide their first steps in
this complicated and delicate setup (to a scientist, printing is
&quot;applying a structured deposition of distinct patterns of ink or toner
particles on paper substrates&quot; <span class="emphasis"><em>;-)</em></span>, he started to
build in a little Postgres database with information about the
hardware and driver zoo that made up Linux printing of the time. This
database became the core component of today's Foomatic collection of
tools and data. In the meantime it has moved to an XML representation
of the data.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2936022"></a>Foomatic's strange Name</h4></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2936030"></a><p>
&quot;Why the funny name?&quot;, you ask. When it really took off, around spring
2000, CUPS was far less popular than today, and most systems used LPD,
LPRng or even PDQ to print. CUPS shipped with a few generic &quot;drivers&quot;
(good for a few hundred different printer models). These didn't
support many device-specific options. CUPS also shipped with its own
built-in rasterization filter (&quot;pstoraster&quot;, derived from
Ghostscript). On the other hand, CUPS provided brilliant support for
<span class="emphasis"><em>controlling</em></span> all printer options through
standardized and well-defined &quot;PPD files&quot; (PostScript Printers
Description files). Plus, CUPS was designed to be easily extensible.
</p><p>
Grant already had in his database a respectable compilation
of facts about a many more printers, and the Ghostscript &quot;drivers&quot;
they run with. His idea, to generate PPDs from the database info
and use them to make standard Ghostscript filters work within CUPS,
proved to work very well. It also &quot;killed several birds with one
stone&quot;:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It made all current and future Ghostscript filter
developments available for CUPS;</p></li><li><p>It made available a lot of additional printer models
to CUPS users (because often the &quot;traditional&quot; Ghostscript way of
printing was the only one available);</p></li><li><p>It gave all the advanced CUPS options (web interface,
GUI driver configurations) to users wanting (or needing) to use
Ghostscript filters.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2936123"></a>cupsomatic, pdqomatic, lpdomatic, directomatic</h4></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2936133"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2936141"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2936149"></a><p>
CUPS worked through a quickly-hacked up filter script named <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=cupsomatic&amp;show=0" target="_top">cupsomatic</a>.
cupsomatic ran the printfile through Ghostscript, constructing
automatically the rather complicated command line needed. It just
required to be copied into the CUPS system to make it work. To
&quot;configure&quot; the way cupsomatic controls the Ghostscript rendering
process, it needs a CUPS-PPD. This PPD is generated directly from the
contents of the database. For CUPS and the respective printer/filter
combo another Perl script named &quot;CUPS-O-Matic&quot; did the PPD
generation. After that was working, Grant implemented within a few
days a similar thing for two other spoolers. Names chosen for the
config-generator scripts were <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=lpdomatic&amp;show=0" target="_top">PDQ-O-Matic</a>
(for PDQ) and <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=lpdomatic&amp;show=0" target="_top">LPD-O-Matic</a>
(for - you guessed it - LPD); the configuration here didn't use PPDs
but other spooler-specific files.
</p><p>
From late summer of that year, <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/till/" target="_top">Till Kamppeter</a>
started to put work into the database. Till had been newly employed by
<a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/" target="_top">MandrakeSoft</a> to
convert their printing system over to CUPS, after they had seen his
<a href="http://www.fltk.org/" target="_top">FLTK</a>-based <a href="http://cups.sourceforge.net/xpp/" target="_top">XPP</a> (a GUI frontend to
the CUPS lp-command). He added a huge amount of new information and new
printers. He also developed the support for other spoolers, like
<a href="http://ppr.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">PPR</a> (via ppromatic),
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpr/" target="_top">GNUlpr</a> and
<a href="http://www.lprng.org/" target="_top">LPRng</a> (both via an extended
lpdomatic) and &quot;spoolerless&quot; printing (<a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download.cgi?filename=directomatic&amp;show=0" target="_top">directomatic</a>)....
</p><p>
So, to answer your question: &quot;Foomatic&quot; is the general name for all
the overlapping code and data behind the &quot;*omatic&quot; scripts.... --
Foomatic up to versions 2.0.x required (ugly) Perl data structures
attached the Linuxprinting.org PPDs for CUPS. It had a different
&quot;*omatic&quot; script for every spooler, as well as different printer
configuration files..
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2936304"></a>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Grand Unification</em></span>
achieved...</h4></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2936316"></a><p>
This all has changed in Foomatic versions 2.9 (Beta) and released as
&quot;stable&quot; 3.0. This has now achieved the convergence of all *omatic
scripts: it is called the <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=0" target="_top">foomatic-rip</a>.
This single script is the unification of the previously different
spooler-specific *omatic scripts. foomatic-rip is used by all the
different spoolers alike. Because foomatic-rip can read PPDs (both the
original PostScript printer PPDs and the Linuxprinting.org-generated
ones), all of a sudden all supported spoolers can have the power of
PPDs at their disposal; users only need to plug &quot;foomatic-rip&quot; into
their system.... For users there is improved media type and source
support; paper sizes and trays are easier to configure.
</p><p>
Also, the New Generation of Linuxprinting.org PPDs doesn't contain
Perl data structures any more. If you are a distro maintainer and have
used the previous version of Foomatic, you may want to give the new
one a spin: but don't forget to generate a new-version set of PPDs,
via the new <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/foomatic/foomatic-db-engine-3.0.0beta1.tar.gz" target="_top">foomatic-db-engine</a>!
Individual users just need to generate a single new PPD specific to
their model by <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/II.Foomatic-User/II.tutorial-handout-foomatic-user.html" target="_top">following
the steps</a> outlined in the Foomatic tutorial or further
below. This new development is truly amazing.
</p><p>
foomatic-rip is a very clever wrapper around the need to run
Ghostscript with a different syntax, different options, different
device selections and/or different filters for each different printer
or different spooler. At the same time it can read the PPD associated
with a print queue and modify the print job according to the user
selections. Together with this comes the 100% compliance of the new
Foomatic PPDs with the Adobe spec. Some really innovative features of
the Foomatic concept will surprise users: it will support custom paper
sizes for many printers; and it will support printing on media drawn
from different paper trays within the same job (in both cases: even
where there is no support for this from Windows-based vendor printer
drivers).
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2936409"></a>Driver Development outside</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Most driver development itself does not happen within
Linuxprinting.org. Drivers are written by independent maintainers.
Linuxprinting.org just pools all the information, and stores it in its
database. In addition, it also provides the Foomatic glue to integrate
the many drivers into any modern (or legacy) printing system known to
the world.
</p><p>
Speaking of the different driver development groups: most of
the work is currently done in three projects. These are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/linux/projects/omni/" target="_top">Omni</a>
-- a Free Software project by IBM which tries to convert their printer
driver knowledge from good-ol' OS/2 times into a modern, modular,
universal driver architecture for Linux/UNIX (still Beta).  This
currently supports 437 models.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://hpinkjet.sf.net/" target="_top">HPIJS</a> --
a Free Software project by HP to provide the support for their own
range of models (very mature, printing in most cases is perfect and
provides true photo quality). This currently supports 369
models.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://gimp-print.sf.net/" target="_top">Gimp-Print</a> -- a Free software
effort, started by Michael Sweet (also lead developer for CUPS), now
directed by Robert Krawitz, which has achieved an amazing level of
photo print quality (many Epson users swear that its quality is
better than the vendor drivers provided by Epson for the Microsoft
platforms). This currently supports 522 models.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2936490"></a>Forums, Downloads, Tutorials, Howtos -- also for Mac OS X and
commercial UNIX</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
Linuxprinting.org today is the one-stop &quot;shop&quot; to download printer
drivers. Look for printer information and <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org//kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/" target="_top">tutorials</a>
or solve printing problems in its popular <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/newsportal/" target="_top">forums</a>.  But
it's not just for GNU/Linux: users and admins of <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/macosx/" target="_top">commercial UNIX
systems</a> are also going there, and the relatively new <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/newsportal/thread.php3?name=linuxprinting.macosx.general" target="_top">Mac
OS X forum</a> has turned out to be one of the most frequented
fora after only a few weeks.
</p><p>
Linuxprinting.org and the Foomatic driver wrappers around Ghostscript
are now a standard toolchain for printing on all the important
distros. Most of them also have CUPS underneath. While in recent years
most printer data had been added by Till (who works at Mandrake), many
additional contributions came from engineers with SuSE, RedHat,
Connectiva, Debian and others. Vendor-neutrality is an important goal
of the Foomatic project.
</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>

it often, please send him a note showing your appreciation.

The Foomatic database is an amazing piece of ingenuity in itself. Not
only does it keep the printer and driver information, but it is
organized in a way that it can generate &quot;PPD&quot; files &quot;on the fly&quot; from
its internal XML-based datasets. While these PPDs are modelled to the
Adobe specification of &quot;PostScript Printer Descriptions&quot; (PPDs), the
Linuxprinting.org/Foomatic-PPDs don't normally drive PostScript
printers: they are used to describe all the bells and whistles you
could ring or blow on an Epson Stylus inkjet, or a HP Photosmart or
what-have-you. The main &quot;trick&quot; is one little additional line, not
envisaged by the PPD specification, starting with the &quot;*cupsFilter&quot;
keyword: it tells the CUPS daemon how to proceed with the PostScript
print file (old-style Foomatic-PPDs named the
<span class="emphasis"><em>cupsomatic</em></span> filter script, while the new-style
PPDs now call <span class="emphasis"><em>foomatic-rip</em></span>). This filter
script calls Ghostscript on the host system (the recommended variant
is ESP Ghostscript) to do the rendering work. foomatic-rip knows which
filter or internal device setting it should ask from Ghostscript to
convert the PostScript printjob into a raster format ready for the
target device. This usage of PPDs to describe the options of non-PS
printers was the invention of the CUPS developers. The rest is easy:
GUI tools (like KDE's marvellous <a href="http://printing.kde.org/overview/kprinter.phtml" target="_top">&quot;kprinter&quot;</a>,
or the GNOME <a href="http://gtklp.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">&quot;gtklp&quot;</a>, &quot;xpp&quot; and the CUPS
web interface) read the PPD too and use this information to present
the available settings to the user as an intuitive menu selection.

the PPD to a suitable place on your harddisk, say
<tt class="filename">/path/to/my-printer.ppd</tt> (if you prefer to install
your printers with the help of the CUPS web interface, save the PPD to
the <tt class="filename">/usr/share/cups/model/</tt> path and re-start
cupsd).</p></li><li><p>Then install the printer with a suitable commandline,
e.g.: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -p laserjet4plus -v parallel:/dev/lp0 -E -P path/to/my-printer.ppd</tt></b>
</pre></li><li><p>Note again this: for all the new-style &quot;Foomatic-PPDs&quot;
from Linuxprinting.org, you also need a special &quot;CUPS filter&quot; named
&quot;foomatic-rip&quot;.Get the latest version of &quot;foomatic-rip&quot; from: <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=0" target="_top">http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=0</a>
</p></li><li><p>The foomatic-rip Perlscript itself also makes some
interesting reading (<a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=1" target="_top">http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic2.9/download.cgi?filename=foomatic-rip&amp;show=1</a>),
because it is very well documented by Till's inline comments (even
non-Perl hackers will learn quite a bit about printing by reading
it... ;-)</p></li><li><p>Save foomatic-rip either directly in
<tt class="filename">/usr/lib/cups/filter/foomatic-rip</tt> or somewhere in
your $PATH (and don't forget to make it world-executable). Again,
don't save by &quot;copy'n'paste&quot; but use the appropriate link, or the
&quot;Save as...&quot;  menu item in your browser.</p></li><li><p>If you save foomatic-rip in your $PATH, create a symlink:
<b class="command">cd /usr/lib/cups/filter/ ; ln -s `which
foomatic-rip`</b>. For CUPS to discover this new
available filter at startup, you need to re-start
cupsd.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you print to a printqueue set up with the Foomatic-PPD, CUPS will
insert the appropriate commands and comments into the resulting
PostScript jobfile. foomatic-rip is able to read and act upon
these. foomatic-rip uses some specially encoded Foomatic comments,
embedded in the jobfile. These in turn are used to construct
(transparently for you, the user) the complicated ghostscript command
line telling for the printer driver how exactly the resulting raster
data should look like and which printer commands to embed into the
data stream.
</p><p>
You need:

Often there are questions regarding &quot;print quotas&quot; wherein Samba users
(that is, Windows clients) should not be able to print beyond a
certain amount of pages or data volume per day, week or month. This
feature is dependent on the real print subsystem you're using.
Samba's part is always to receive the job files from the clients
(filtered <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> unfiltered) and hand it over to this
printing subsystem.
</p><p>
Of course one could &quot;hack&quot; things with one's own scripts. But then
there is CUPS. CUPS supports &quot;quotas&quot; which can be based on sizes of
jobs or on the number of pages or both, and are spanning any time
period you want.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2937193"></a>Setting up Quotas</h3></div></div><div></div></div><a class="indexterm" name="id2937200"></a><p>
This is an example command how root would set a print quota in CUPS,
assuming an existing printer named &quot;quotaprinter&quot;:
</p><a class="indexterm" name="id2937220"></a><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -p quotaprinter -o job-quota-period=604800 \
	-o job-k-limit=1024 -o job-page-limit=100</tt></b>
</pre><p>
This would limit every single user to print 100 pages or 1024 KB of
data (whichever comes first) within the last 604,800 seconds ( = 1
week).
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2937258"></a>Correct and incorrect Accounting</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
For CUPS to count correctly, the printfile needs to pass the CUPS
&quot;pstops&quot; filter, otherwise it uses a &quot;dummy&quot; count of &quot;1&quot;.  Some
printfiles don't pass it (eg: image files) but then those are mostly 1
page jobs anyway. This also means that proprietary drivers for the
target printer running on the client computers and CUPS/Samba, which
then spool these files as &quot;raw&quot; (i.e. leaving them untouched, not
filtering them), will be counted as &quot;1-pagers&quot; too!
</p><p>
You need to send PostScript from the clients (i.e. run a PostScript
driver there) to have the chance to get accounting done. If the
printer is a non-PostScript model, you need to let CUPS do the job to
convert the file to a print-ready format for the target printer. This
will be working for currently about 1,000 different printer models,
see <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi" target="_top">the driver list at linuxprinting.org/</a>.

Before CUPS-1.1.16 your only option was to use the Adobe PostScript
Driver on the Windows clients. The output of this driver was not
always passed through the &quot;pstops&quot; filter on the CUPS/Samba side, and
therefore was not counted correctly (the reason is that it often,
depending on the &quot;PPD&quot; being used, wrote a &quot;PJL&quot;-header in front of
the real PostScript which caused CUPS to skip pstops and go directly
to the &quot;pstoraster&quot; stage).
</p><p>
From CUPS-1.1.16 onward you can use the &quot;CUPS PostScript Driver for
Windows NT/2K/XP clients&quot; (which is tagged in the download area of
http://www.cups.org/ as the &quot;cups-samba-1.1.16.tar.gz&quot; package). It does
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> work for Win9x/ME clients. But it guarantees:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><a class="indexterm" name="id2937350"></a><ul type="disc"><li><p>to not write an PJL-header</p></li><li><p>to still read and support all PJL-options named in the
driver PPD with its own means</p></li><li><p> that the file will pass through the &quot;pstops&quot; filter
on the CUPS/Samba server</p></li><li><p>to page-count correctly the
printfile</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can read more about the setup of this combination in the manpage
for &quot;cupsaddsmb&quot; (which is only present with CUPS installed, and only
current from CUPS 1.1.16).

A printer queue with <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> PPD associated to it is a
&quot;raw&quot; printer and all files will go directly there as received by the
spooler. The exceptions are file types &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;
which need &quot;passthrough feature&quot; enabled. &quot;Raw&quot; queues don't do any
filtering at all, they hand the file directly to the CUPS backend.
This backend is responsible for the sending of the data to the device
(as in the &quot;device URI&quot; notation: <tt class="filename">lpd://, socket://,
smb://, ipp://, http://, parallel:/, serial:/, usb:/</tt> etc.)
</p><p>
&quot;cupsomatic&quot;/Foomatic are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> native CUPS drivers
and they don't ship with CUPS. They are a Third Party add-on,
developed at Linuxprinting.org. As such, they are a brilliant hack to
make all models (driven by Ghostscript drivers/filters in traditional
spoolers) also work via CUPS, with the same (good or bad!) quality as
in these other spoolers. &quot;cupsomatic&quot; is only a vehicle to execute a
ghostscript commandline at that stage in the CUPS filtering chain,
where &quot;normally&quot; the native CUPS &quot;pstoraster&quot; filter would kick
in. cupsomatic by-passes pstoraster, &quot;kidnaps&quot; the printfile from CUPS
away and re-directs it to go through Ghostscript. CUPS accepts this,
because the associated CUPS-O-Matic-/Foomatic-PPD specifies:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  *cupsFilter:  &quot;application/vnd.cups-postscript 0 cupsomatic&quot;
</pre><p>
This line persuades CUPS to hand the file to cupsomatic, once it has
successfully converted it to the MIME type
&quot;application/vnd.cups-postscript&quot;. This conversion will not happen for
Jobs arriving from Windows which are auto-typed
&quot;application/octet-stream&quot;, with the according changes in
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt> in place.
</p><p>
CUPS is widely configurable and flexible, even regarding its filtering
mechanism. Another workaround in some situations would be to have in
<tt class="filename">/etc/cups/mime.types</tt> entries as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
 application/postscript           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
 application/vnd.cups-postscript  application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</pre><p>
This would prevent all Postscript files from being filtered (rather,
they will through the virtual <span class="emphasis"><em>nullfilter</em></span>
denoted with &quot;-&quot;).  This could only be useful for PS printers. If you
want to print PS code on non-PS printers (provided they support ASCII
text printing) an entry as follows could be useful:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
 */*           application/vnd.cups-raw  0  -
</pre><p>
and would effectively send <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> files to the
backend without further processing.
</p><p>
Lastly, you could have the following entry:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
application/vnd.cups-postscript application/vnd.cups-raw 0 my_PJL_stripping_filter
</pre><p>
You will need to write a <span class="emphasis"><em>my_PJL_stripping_filter</em></span>
(could be a shellscript) that parses the PostScript and removes the
unwanted PJL. This would need to conform to CUPS filter design
(mainly, receive and pass the parameters printername, job-id,
username, jobtitle, copies, print options and possibly the
filename). It would be installed as world executable into
<tt class="filename">/usr/lib/cups/filters/</tt> and will be called by CUPS
if it encounters a MIME type &quot;application/vnd.cups-postscript&quot;.
</p><p>
CUPS can handle <span class="emphasis"><em>-o job-hold-until=indefinite</em></span>.
This keeps the job in the queue &quot;on hold&quot;. It will only be printed
upon manual release by the printer operator. This is a requirement in
many &quot;central reproduction departments&quot;, where a few operators manage
the jobs of hundreds of users on some big machine, where no user is
allowed to have direct access (such as when the operators often need
to load the proper paper type before running the 10,000 page job
requested by marketing for the mailing, etc.).

Samba print files pass through two &quot;spool&quot; directories. One is the

</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">PreserveJobHistory Yes</span></dt><dd><p>
This keeps some details of jobs in cupsd's mind (well it keeps the
&quot;c12345&quot;, &quot;c12346&quot; etc. files in the CUPS spool directory, which do a
similar job as the old-fashioned BSD-LPD control files). This is set
to &quot;Yes&quot; as a default.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">PreserveJobFiles Yes</span></dt><dd><p>
This keeps the job files themselves in cupsd's mind
(well it keeps the &quot;d12345&quot;, &quot;d12346&quot; etc. files in the CUPS spool
directory...). This is set to &quot;No&quot; as the CUPS
default.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>&quot;MaxJobs 500&quot;</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
This directive controls the maximum number of jobs
that are kept in memory. Once the number of jobs reaches the limit,
the oldest completed job is automatically purged from the system to
make room for the new one. If all of the known jobs are still

maximum to 0 disables this functionality. The default setting is
0.

From time to time the question arises, how you can print
<span class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> a Windows attached printer
<span class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> Samba. Normally the local connection
from Windows host to printer would be done by USB or parallel
cable, but this doesn't matter to Samba. From here only an SMB
connection needs to be opened to the Windows host. Of course, this
printer must be &quot;shared&quot; first. As you have learned by now, CUPS uses
<span class="emphasis"><em>backends</em></span> to talk to printers and other
servers. To talk to Windows shared printers you need to use the
<span class="emphasis"><em>smb</em></span> (surprise, surprise!) backend. Check if this
is in the CUPS backend directory. This resides usually in
<tt class="filename">/usr/lib/cups/backend/</tt>. You need to find a &quot;smb&quot;
file there. It should be a symlink to <tt class="filename">smbspool</tt>
which file must exist and be executable:

smbspool has been written by Mike Sweet from the CUPS folks.  It is
included and ships with Samba. It may also be used with print
subsystems other than CUPS, to spool jobs to Windows printer shares. To
set up printer &quot;winprinter&quot; on CUPS, you need to have a &quot;driver&quot; for
it. Essentially this means to convert the print data on the CUPS/Samba
host to a format that the printer can digest (the Windows host is
unable to convert any files you may send).  This also means you should
be able to print to the printer if it were hooked directly at your
Samba/CUPS host. For troubleshooting purposes, this is what you
should do, to determine if that part of the process chain is in
order. Then proceed to fix the network connection/authentication to
the Windows host, etc.
</p><p>
To install a printer with the smb backend on CUPS, use this command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt><b class="userinput"><tt>lpadmin -p winprinter -v smb://WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename \
  -P /path/to/PPD</tt></b>
</pre><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>PPD</em></span> must be able to direct CUPS to generate
the print data for the target model. For PostScript printers just use
the PPD that would be used with the Windows NT PostScript driver. But
what can you do if the printer is only accessible with a password? Or
if the printer's host is part of another workgroup? This is provided
for: you can include the required parameters as part of the
<tt class="filename">smb://</tt> device-URI. Like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>smb://WORKGROUP/WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename </p></li><li><p>smb://username:password@WORKGROUP/WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename</p></li><li><p>smb://username:password@WINDOWSNETBIOSNAME/printersharename</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that the device-URI will be visible in the process list of the
Samba server (e.g. when someone uses the <b class="command">ps -aux</b>
command on Linux), even if the username and passwords are sanitized
before they get written into the log files.  So this is an inherently
insecure option. However it is the only one. Don't use it if you want
to protect your passwords. Better share the printer in a way that
doesn't require a password! Printing will only work if you have a
working netbios name resolution up and running. Note that this is a
feature of CUPS and you don't necessarily need to have smbd running
(but who wants that? :-).
