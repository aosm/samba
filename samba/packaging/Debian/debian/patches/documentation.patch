 WARNING:</strong> You will need to use at least Samba 2.1 to ensure that PDC functionality for Windows NT clients is present. Prior to Samba 2.1, only limited user authentication for NT clients was present. At the time this book went to press, Samba 2.0.5 was the latest version, but Samba  2.1 was available through CVS download.
